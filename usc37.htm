<p class="note-body">The definitions in clauses (1) and (2), (6)–(10), (14)–(21), and (24) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this revised title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used, and so far as possible are identical to those used in title 10, United States Code, containing most of the basic law relating to the armed forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (3), the words “and all Regular and Reserve components thereof”, in section 231(a) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage. Section 231(j) of existing title 37 is omitted as covered by section 1 of title 1.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words “whether under temporary or permanent appointment” are omitted as surplusage. The words “the following pay grades” are substituted for the words “the various pay grades prescribed for commissioned officers by subsection (a) of this section, as follows”. The words “(other than a commissioned warrant officer)” are inserted to conform to the definition of “warrant officer” in section 101(13) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words “with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title” are substituted for the word “minimum”.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c) and (e), the words “with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title” are substituted for the words “with under two cumulative years’ service” and “with under two cumulative years of service”, in sections 308 and 232(e), respectively, of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words “enlisted or appointed under the Army Aviation Cadet Act, as amended, or under the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942, as amended” are omitted as obsolete and surplusage. Both of the cited acts were repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and replaced by various sections of title 10. Further reference is surplusage, however, since aviation cadets are not appointed or enlisted under any provision of law other than the sections of title 10 embodying the former Army Aviation Cadet Act and the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942. The word “basic” is inserted for clarity, since the word “pay” as defined in section 101(21) of this revised title includes special and incentive pays. Incentive pay for aviation cadets is provided in section 301(b) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words “While on active duty”, in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14, are omitted as covered by section 204 of this title which prescribes the conditions under which members of the uniformed services are entitled to basic pay. The words “Unless he is entitled to the basic pay of a higher pay grade” are substituted for the words “or that of his grade, whichever is greater” in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words “Except as provided by subsections (e) and (f)” are inserted to reflect those subsections relating to enlisted aviation cadets or aviation pilots.</p>

<p class="note-body">[The citations to section 232(d) of existing title 37, above, are to the language of subsection (d) set forth in the codification note under section 232, rather than that erroneously set forth in the text of the section.]</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the last 27 words are substituted for the words “or performance of the duties provided for by sections 5, 81, 94, 97 and 99 of the National Defense Act, as amended,” to reflect the current citations. So much of the introductory clause as follows the exception is substituted for the 36 words preceding 1st proviso of 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37. The words “on the active list” are omitted as covered by the words “active duty” as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title. The words “(provided for or authorized in the National Defense Act, as amended, or in the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, as amended)” are omitted as covered by the words “provided by law”.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words “For the purposes of subsection (a)” are inserted for clarity. The words “active duty for a period of more than 30 days” are substituted for the words “extended active duty in excess of thirty days”. The words “call or” are inserted to conform to the words “called or”.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words “and allowances” are omitted, since, under chapter 7 of this revised title, entitlement to allowances depends upon entitlement to basic pay. The last sentence is substituted for the last 38 words of the 2d proviso of the 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words “for the purposes of this section” are substituted for the words “and which entitles them to receive basic pay . . . in the service of the United States”. The words “pursuant to this section” are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words “or active duty for training” are omitted as covered by the words “active duty” as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words “is appointed” are substituted for the words “has been or may be commissioned”. The words “under the laws appointing such graduates to the Army” and the last 16 words of section 308a of existing title 37 are omitted as surplusage. The words “to the date of his acceptance of and qualification under his commission” are omitted, since the member concerned would continue to be entitled to basic pay after that acceptance and qualification. The words “or the United States Naval Academy” are inserted to reflect section 541 of title 10, under which graduates of that Academy may be appointed in the Army or the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), the inclusion of the Coast Guard Reserve is based on the authority contained in section 755(c) of title 14.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the introductory clause is substituted for section 233(a) (introductory clause) of existing title 37. In clauses (1) and (2), the word “officer” is substituted for the words “commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, warrant officer” to conform to the definition of “officer” in section 101(11) of this revised title. In clause (1), the words “Regular or Reserve component” are omitted, since, under the definition of “reserve component” in section 102(k) of the source statute, those words are defined to include members without component status. Together, these categories compose the entire structure of any uniformed service. In clause (2)(F), the words “a reserve component of a uniformed service” are substituted for the words “the National Guard of the United States, or in the Organized Reserve Corps, or in the Officers’ Reserve Corps, or in the Enlisted Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Navy, or in the Dental Reserve Corps of the Navy . . . or in the Naval Reserve . . .or in the Air National Guard of the United States, or in the Air Force Reserve, or in the officers’ section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the enlisted section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the Air Corps Reserve . . . or in the Marine Corps Reserve, or in the Coast Guard Reserve, or in the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service,” since all of the named organizations were or are reserve components. In clause (4), the words “as it existed at any time before April 16, 1947” are inserted for clarity, since the reference is intended to apply to the corps established by law before April 16, 1947. Service in the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps now existing would be included under clause (1) or (2), since there is now no legal distinction between the service of nurses and that of other members of the Army and Navy. In clause (6), the date “January 1, 1961,” is substituted for the words “the effective date of this section,” to reflect laws enacted after that effective date which authorized certain service to be credited for pay purposes. See, for example, Public Law 86–142. Clause (9) is substituted for section 233(b) (less proviso) of existing title 37.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the years of service of a member as an air weapons controller shall be computed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, from the date the member begins training leading to a designation as an air weapons controller, but there shall be excluded from such computation any period of more than 90 days during which the member performs primary duties other than as an air weapons controller.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of incentive pay for any hazardous duty described in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A member is entitled to not more than two payments of incentive pay, authorized by this section, for a period of time during which he qualifies for more than one payment of that pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the President and to the extent provided for by appropriations, when a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard, who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a) for members entitled to basic pay, he is entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c), as the case may be, for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of a corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay. He is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title. This subsection does not apply to a member who is entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title for the entire month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If in any calendar month a member performs duty as described in paragraph (1) and while entitled to basic pay also performs hazardous duty as described in the same clause of subsection (a) as constitutes the predicate for his entitlement under paragraph (1), the earned units of measuring entitlement for incentive pay under this section shall be combined. If the sum of units determined under the preceding sentence equals or exceeds the minimum standard prescribed by the President for entitlement to pay specified under subsections (b) and (c) for a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire relevant month, the member shall be entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c) for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A member who qualifies for entitlement under this paragraph is entitled to the increase for each day in the relevant month in which he is entitled to basic pay pursuant to section 204 of this title or to compensation under section 206 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In this paragraph, the term,<sup><a href="#301_1_target" name="301_1">1</a></sup> “units” means the significant increments of performance prescribed as qualifying standards in regulations promulgated by the President pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words “is also entitled” are substituted for the words “shall, in addition thereto, be entitled”. The words “For the purposes of this subsection” are inserted for clarity. The word “competent” is omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words preceding the tables are substituted for section 235(b) (words preceding tables) of existing title 37. The words “Years of service computed under section 205” are inserted in the tables for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words “a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard” are substituted for the enumeration of the organizations concerned in section 301(d) of existing title 37. The words “when . . . performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a)(1)–(11) for members entitled to basic pay” are substituted for the words “when required by competent orders to perform any hazardous duty prescribed by or pursuant to section 235 of this title for members of the uniformed services entitled to receive basic pay and when in consequence of such orders they do perform any hazardous duty so prescribed”.

At the time of the enactment of the source statute, additional pay was authorized as “flight pay”. However, the Career Compensation Act of 1949 did not authorize “flight pay” but provided incentive pay in section 204(a)(1) [now section 301(a)(1) of this revised title] for “duty as a crew member . . . involving frequent and regular participation in aerial flight”. The words “before January 2 of each year” are substituted for the words “On or before January 1, annually”. The word “grade” is substituted for the word “rank” to conform to the definition in section 101(15) of this revised title.</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) Members of reserve components of the uniformed services who have complied with requirements prescribed in this section shall be entitled to receive incentive pay for both active-duty and inactive-duty training performed during such period.</p>

<p class="note-body">(g) The term “duty involving the servicing of aircraft or missiles with highly toxic fuels or propellants or the testing of aircraft or missile systems (or components of such systems) during which highly toxic fuels or propellants are used” shall be construed to mean duty performed by members as a primary duty that requires (1) removal, replacement, and servicing of the emergency power unit of an aircraft with H–70 propellant (30 percent water, 70 percent hydrazine); (2) participation by those personnel performing duties described in (g)(1) who must also participate in an emergency response force, spill containment, or spill cleanup involving H–70 propellant (30 percent water, 70 percent hydrazine); (3) handling and maintaining the liquid propellants (liquid oxidizer-nitrogen tetroxide; unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) used in the Titan weapon system, if such duty requires qualification in the use of the Rocket Fuel Handler's Clothing Outfit and involves (A) launch duct operations, including flow, pressurization, on-load, set-up or tear down involving propellant transfer operations; (B) set-up, installation or tear down for fuel/oxidizer flow; (C) decontamination of equipment, including, but not limited to, the Rocket Fuel Handler's Clothing Outfit; (D) venting or pressurizing missile fuel or oxidizer tanks; (E) removing or replacing missile components while missile fuel and oxidizer tanks are loaded with such propellants; (F) transferring propellants between commercial and military holding trailers, or between holding trailers and fuel/oxidizer pump rooms; or normal preventive maintenance activities including, but not limited to, seal changes; (4) handling and maintaining the propellants, unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and inhibited red-fuming nitric acid, used in the LANCE missile system; (5) handling, transporting or working with toxic fuels/propellants by members assigned to the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Lab (AFRPL) who (A) directly manage and inspect the activities of crew members conducting operations involving experimental rocket propulsion systems and components; (B) directly monitor and set up measurement instruments in operational areas where contamination is suspected or may be physically present; (C) install and remove instrumentation devices from propulsion systems and components; (D) perform final test preparation and immediate safety inspection duties around pressurized, active systems during prerun and postrun test periods; or, (E) install and repair electrical systems; (6) handling, loading/unloading and transporting toxic fuels and oxidizers at the precision sled track while working with the liquid rocket sled, which uses JP–X (a mixture of jet fuel (JP–4) and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) and red-fuming nitric acid and a propulsion; or (7) involvement with other toxic substances contained in missile or aircraft weapon system fuels or propellants as determined by the Secretary concerned. The entitlement to the pay provided for in this subsection is based upon the performance of such duty which has the potential for accidental or inadvertent exposure to highly toxic fuels or propellants or related substances and not upon actual quantifiable exposure to such substances. Therefore, neither this construction of the term nor the receipt of the pay provided for in this subsection may be construed as indicating that any person entitled to such pay has been actually exposed to highly toxic fuels or propellants or related substances contrary to the provisions of any statute, Executive order, rule, or regulation relating to health or safety which is applicable to the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) The term “duty involving frequent and regular exposure to highly toxic pesticides” shall be construed to mean duty performed by members who, while under competent orders assigning such members to the entomology, pest control, pest management, or preventive medicine functions of a uniformed service for a period of 30 consecutive days or more, are required to perform in any calendar month a fumigation task utilizing (1) phosphine, sulfuryl fluoride, hydrogen cyanide, methyl bromide, or (2) a fumigant of comparable high acute toxicity and hazard potential. The use of solid fumigant formulations, such as aluminum phosphide, magnesium phosphide and calcium cyanide, in the outdoor control of burrowing animals does not qualify a member for incentive pay under this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The term “duty involving laboratory work that utilizes live dangerous viruses or bacteria” shall be construed to mean primary duty performed by members who work with micro-organisms (1) that cause disease (A) with a high potential for mortality, and (B) for which effective therapeutic procedures are not available, and (2) for which no effective prophylactic immunization exists, while such members are assigned by competent orders for a period of 30 consecutive days or more to participate in or conduct applied or basic research that is characterized by a changing variety of techniques, procedures, equipment, and experiments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(j) The term “the handling of chemical munitions (or components of such munitions)” shall be construed to mean duty performed by members as a primary duty which routinely requires (1) direct physical handling of toxic chemical munitions incident to storage, maintenance, testing, surveillance, assembly, disassembly, demilitarization, or disposal of said munitions; (2) direct physical handling of chemical surety material, as defined by the Secretary concerned, incident to manufacture, storage, testing, laboratory analysis, detoxification, or disposal of said material; (3) direct physical handling of toxic chemical munitions incident to technical escort of shipments of said munitions; (4) direct physical handling of chemical surety material, as defined by the Secretary concerned incident to technical escort of shipments of said material. The term does not include the handling of the individual components of binary chemical agents or munitions. The term does not include user handling incident to loading, firing, or otherwise launching the toxic chemical munitions nor field storage operations during hostilities. The term also excludes the handling of Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation Dilute Solutions of toxic chemicals as defined by the Secretary concerned. It also excludes the handling of riot control agents, chemical defoliants and herbicides, smoke, flame and incendiaries, and industrial chemicals. The entitlement to the pay provided for in this subsection is based upon the performance of such duty that has the potential for accidental exposure to chemical agents and not upon actual quantifiable exposure to such agents. Therefore, neither the construction of the term nor the receipt of pay provided for in this subsection may be construed as indicating that any person entitled to such pay actually has been exposed to chemical agents contrary to the provisions of any statute, executive order, rule, or regulations relating to the health and safety which is applicable to the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 110.

Dual payments of incentive pay shall be limited to those members who are required by competent orders to perform specific multiple hazardous duties in order to carry out their assigned missions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 113. The Secretaries concerned are hereby authorized to prescribe such supplementary regulations not inconsistent herewith as they may deem necessary or desirable for carrying out these regulations, and such supplementary regulations shall be uniform for all the services to the fullest extent practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 114. Under such regulations as the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe with respect to enlisted members within their respective jurisdictions, any enlisted member who has been required by competent orders to perform duty as a crew member involving frequent and regular participation in aerial flight shall, if he is involuntarily removed from the performance of that duty, under circumstances prescribed by such regulations with less than 120 days’ advance notice, be deemed to have fulfilled all of the requirements for payment of incentive pay under section 301(a)(1) or (f) of title 37 of the United States Code, for that duty for up to 120 days after the date on which he was notified of such removal.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is also entitled to aviation career incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational or proficiency flying duty required by orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Aviation career incentive pay shall be restricted to regular and reserve officers who hold, or are in training leading to, an aeronautical rating or designation and who engage and remain in aviation service on a career basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, or the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to members under their respective jurisdiction, an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) that is applicable to him. A flight surgeon or other medical officer who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is not entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay but is entitled to monthly incentive pay in the amounts set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational flying duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay, an officer must perform the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for 8 of the first 12, and 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer. However, if an officer performs the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for at least 10 but less than 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer, the officer will be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay for the first 22 years of aviation service of the officer. Entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases for an officer (other than a warrant officer) upon completion of 25 years of aviation service, but such an officer in a pay grade below pay grade O–7 remains entitled to monthly incentive pay under subsection (b)(1) for the performance of operational flying duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service it is determined that an officer has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases. For the needs of the service, the Secretary concerned may permit, on a case by case basis, an officer to continue to receive continuous monthly incentive pay despite the failure of the officer to perform the prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time so long as the officer has performed those requirements for not less than 6 years of aviation service. The Secretary concerned may not delegate the authority in the preceding sentence to permit the payment of incentive pay under this subsection. If at the completion of 12 years of aviation service entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases, entitlement to that pay may again commence at the completion of 18 years of aviation service upon completion of the minimum operational flying duty requirements, such pay to continue for a period of time as prescribed in accordance with this section. However, if entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases in the case of any officer at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service, such officer remains entitled to monthly incentive pay for the performance of subsequent operational or proficiency flying duties up to the maximum period of time prescribed in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term “aviation service” means service performed by an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) while holding an aeronautical rating or designation or while in training to receive an aeronautical rating or designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term “operational flying duty” means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying skills normally are maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the Secretary concerned, and flying performed by members in training that leads to the award of an aeronautical rating or designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term “proficiency flying duty” means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which such skills would normally not be maintained in the performance of assigned duties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The term “officer” includes an individual enlisted, and designated, as an aviation cadet under section 6911 of title 10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of the naval service who is entitled to basic pay, and (A) holds (or is in training leading to) a submarine duty designator, (B) is in and remains in the submarine service on a career basis, and (C) meets the requirements of paragraph (3), is entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of the naval service who is entitled to basic pay but is not entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay under paragraph (1) is entitled to submarine duty incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) for any period during which such member performs frequent an regular operational submarine duty (as defined in paragraph (5)) required by orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To be entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay through 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), a member must perform operational submarine duties for at least 6 of the first 12, and at least 10 of the first 18, years of his submarine service. However, if a member performs the prescribed operational submarine duties for at least 8 but less than 10 of the first 18 years of his submarine service, he is entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay for the first 22 years of his service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 year sof submarine service it is determined that a member has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational submarine duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases. If entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases upon completion of 12 years of submarine service, entitlement to that pay may again commence upon completion of 18 years of submarine service if the minimum operational submarine duty requirements have been met, and such pay shall continue for the period of time prescribed in accordance with this section. However, if entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases in the case of any member at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of submarine service or 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), such member shall be entitled to that pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) for the performance of subsequent operational submarine duty, or for the performance of service as a member of a submarine operational command staff, if such member's duties require serving on a submarine during underway operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In this section:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) during one calendar month: 48 hours, except that hours served underway in excess of 48 as a member of a submarine operational command staff during any of the immediately preceding five calendar months and not already used to qualify for incentive pay may be applied to satisfy the underway time requirements for the current month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) during any two consecutive calendar months when the requirements of subclause (I) of this clause have not been met: 96 hours; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) during any three consecutive calendar months when the requirements of subclause (II) of this clause have not been met: 144 hours;</p>

Upon acceptance of the agreement by the Secretary or his designee, the total amount payable shall be paid in equal annual installments over the length of the contract, commencing at the expiration of any existing period of obligated active service. The Secretary (or his designee) may accept an active service agreement under this section not more than one year in advance of the end of an officer's existing period of obligated active service under such an agreement.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a member described in subsection (b) who establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary concerned that the allotment of the member's household under the food stamp program, calculated in the absence of the supplemental subsistence allowance, would exceed the amount established by the Secretary concerned under paragraph (2), the amount of the supplemental subsistence allowance for the member shall be equal to the lesser of the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining whether a member meets the eligibility criteria under paragraph (1), the Secretary—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall not take into consideration the amount of the supplemental subsistence allowance payable under this section; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall take into consideration the amount of the basic allowance for housing that the member receives under section 403 of this title or would otherwise receive under such section, in the case of a member who is not entitled to that allowance as a result of assignment to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Application for Allowance</cap-smallcap>.—To request the supplemental subsistence allowance, a member shall submit an application to the Secretary concerned in such form and containing such information as the Secretary concerned may prescribe.

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effective Period</cap-smallcap>.—The entitlement of a member to receive the supplemental subsistence allowance terminates upon the occurrence of any of the following events, even though the member continues to meet the eligibility criteria described in subsection (b):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Payment of the supplemental subsistence allowance for 12 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Promotion of the member to a higher grade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Transfer of the member in a permanent change of station.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Reapplication</cap-smallcap>.—Upon the termination of the effective period of the supplemental subsistence allowance for a member, or in anticipation of the imminent termination of the allowance, a member may reapply for the allowance under subsection (c), and the Secretary concerned shall approve the application and resume payment of the allowance to the member, if the member continues to meet, or once again meets, the eligibility criteria described in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Reporting Requirement</cap-smallcap>.—Not later than March 1 of each year after 2001, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report specifying the number of members of the armed forces who received, at any time during the preceding year, the supplemental subsistence allowance. In preparing the report, the Secretary of Defense shall consult with the Secretary of Transportation. No report is required under this subsection after March 1, 2006.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§403. Basic allowance for housing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Entitlement</cap-smallcap>.—(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is entitled to a basic allowance for housing at the monthly rates prescribed under this section or another provision of law with regard to the applicable component of the basic allowance for housing. The amount of the basic allowance for housing for a member will vary according to the pay grade in which the member is assigned or distributed for basic pay purposes, the dependency status of the member, and the geographic location of the member. The basic allowance for housing may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service with dependents is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing as a member with dependents unless the member makes a certification to the Secretary concerned indicating the status of each dependent of the member. The certification shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing Inside the United States</cap-smallcap>.—(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the rates of the basic allowance for housing that are applicable for the various military housing areas in the United States. The rates for an area shall be based on the costs of adequate housing determined for the area under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall determine the costs of adequate housing in a military housing area in the United States for all members of the uniformed services entitled to a basic allowance for housing in that area. The Secretary shall base the determination upon the costs of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area. After June 30, 2001, the Secretary may not differentiate between members with dependents in pay grades E–1 through E–4 in determining what constitutes adequate housing for members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The total amount that may be paid for a fiscal year for the basic allowance for housing under this subsection may not be less than the product of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount authorized to be paid for such allowance for the preceding fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the index of the national average monthly cost of housing for June of the preceding fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the index of the national average monthly cost of housing for June of the second preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An adjustment in the rates of the basic allowance for housing under this subsection as a result of the Secretary's redetermination of housing costs in an area shall take effect on the same date as the effective date of the next increase in basic pay under section 1009 of this title or other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) On and after July 1, 2001, the Secretary of Defense shall establish a single monthly rate for members of the uniformed services with dependents in pay grades E–1 through E–4 in the same military housing area. The rate shall be consistent with the rates paid to members in pay grades other than pay grades E–1 through E–4 and shall be based on the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The average cost of a two-bedroom apartment in that military housing area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) One-half of the difference between the average cost of a two-bedroom townhouse in that area and the amount determined in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing within an area of the United States, the monthly amount of the allowance for the member may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) In the case of a member who is assigned to duty inside the United States, the location or the circumstances of which make it necessary that the member be reassigned under the conditions of low-cost or no-cost permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment, the member may be treated as if the member were not reassigned if the Secretary concerned determines that it would be inequitable to base the member's entitlement to, and amount of, a basic allowance for housing on the cost of housing in the area to which the member is reassigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing Outside the United States</cap-smallcap>.—(1) The Secretary of Defense may prescribe an overseas basic allowance for housing for a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside of the United States. The Secretary shall establish the basic allowance for housing under this subsection on the basis of housing costs in the overseas area in which the member is assigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing in an overseas area and the actual monthly cost of housing for the member is not reduced, the monthly amount of the allowance in an area outside the United States may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member. The monthly amount of the allowance may be adjusted to reflect changes in currency rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a member of the uniformed services authorized to receive an allowance under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned may make a lump-sum payment to the member for required deposits and advance rent, and for expenses relating thereto, that are—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) incurred by the member in occupying private housing outside of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) authorized or approved under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Expenses for which a member may be reimbursed under this paragraph may include losses relating to housing that are sustained by the member as a result of fluctuations in the relative value of the currencies of the United States and the foreign country in which the housing is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary concerned shall recoup the full amount of any deposit or advance rent payments made by the Secretary under subparagraph (A), including any gain resulting from currency fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of recoupment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing When Dependents Are Unable To Accompany Member</cap-smallcap>.—(1) A member of a uniformed service with dependents who is on permanent duty at a location described in paragraph (2) is entitled to a family separation basic allowance for housing under this subsection at a monthly rate equal to the rate of the basic allowance for housing established under subsection (b) or the overseas basic allowance for housing established under subsection (c), whichever applies to that location, for members in the same grade at that location without dependents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A permanent duty location referred to in paragraph (1) is a location—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to which the movement of the member's dependents is not authorized at the expense of the United States under section 406 of this title, and the member's dependents do not reside at or near the location; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at which quarters of the United States are not available for assignment to the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a member with dependents is assigned to duty in an area that is different from the area in which the member's dependents reside, the member is entitled to a basic allowance for housing as provided in subsection (b) or (c), whichever applies to the member, subject to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If the member's assignment to duty in that area, or the circumstances of that assignment, require the member's dependents to reside in a different area, as determined by the Secretary concerned, the amount of the basic allowance for housing for the member shall be based on the area in which the dependents reside or the member's last duty station, whichever the Secretary concerned determines to be most equitable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the member's assignment to duty in that area is under the conditions of a low-cost or no-cost permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment, the amount of the basic allowance for housing for the member shall be based on the member's last duty station if the Secretary concerned determines that it would be inequitable to base the allowance on the cost of housing in the area to which the member is reassigned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The family separation basic allowance for housing under this subsection shall be in addition to any other allowance or per diem that the member is otherwise entitled to receive under this title. A member may receive a basic allowance for housing under both paragraphs (1) and (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Assignment to Quarters</cap-smallcap>.—(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a member of a uniformed service who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service appropriate to the grade, rank, or rating of the member and adequate for the member and dependents of the member, if with dependents, is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member without dependents who is in a pay grade above pay grade E–6 and who is assigned to quarters in the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service, appropriate to the grade or rank of the member and adequate for the member, may elect not to occupy those quarters and instead to receive the basic allowance for housing prescribed for the member's pay grade by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A member without dependents who is in pay grade E–6 and who is assigned to quarters of the United States that do not meet the minimum adequacy standards established by the Secretary of Defense for members in such pay grade, or to a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service that does not meet such standards, may elect not to occupy such quarters or facility and instead to receive the basic allowance for housing prescribed for the member's pay grade under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary concerned may deny the right to make an election under paragraph (2) or (3) if the Secretary determines that the exercise of such an election would adversely affect a training mission, military discipline, or military readiness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A member with dependents who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service may be paid the basic allowance for housing if, because of orders of competent authority, the dependents are prevented from occupying those quarters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Ineligibility During Initial Field Duty or Sea Duty</cap-smallcap>.—(1) A member of a uniformed service without dependents who makes a permanent change of station for assignment to a unit conducting field operations is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing while on that initial field duty unless the commanding officer of the member certifies that the member was necessarily required to procure quarters at the member's expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a member of a uniformed service without dependents who is in a pay grade below pay grade E–6 is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing while the member is on sea duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the Secretary may authorize the payment of a basic allowance for housing to a member of a uniformed service without dependents who is serving in pay grade E–4 or E–5 and is assigned to sea duty. In prescribing regulations under this subparagraph, the Secretary concerned shall consider the availability of quarters for members serving in pay grades E–4 and E–5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding section 421 of this title, two members of the uniformed services in a pay grade below pay grade E–6 who are married to each other, have no other dependents, and are simultaneously assigned to sea duty are jointly entitled to one basic allowance for housing during the period of such simultaneous sea duty. The amount of the allowance shall be based on the without dependents rate for the pay grade of the senior member of the couple. However, this subparagraph shall not apply to a couple if one or both of the members are entitled to a basic allowance for housing under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Department of the Navy, shall prescribe regulations defining the terms “field duty” and “sea duty” for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Reserve Members</cap-smallcap>.—(1) A member of a reserve component without dependents who is called or ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation, or a retired member without dependents who is ordered to active duty under section 688(a) of title 10 in support of a contingency operation, may not be denied a basic allowance for housing if, because of that call or order, the member is unable to continue to occupy a residence—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which is maintained as the primary residence of the member at the time of the call or order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which is owned by the member or for which the member is responsible for rental payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the member is authorized transportation of household goods under section 406 of this title as part of the call or order to active duty described in such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a rate of basic allowance for housing to be paid to a member of a reserve component while the member serves on active duty under a call or order to active duty specifying a period of less than 140 days, unless the call or order to active duty is in support of a contingency operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Rental of Public Quarters</cap-smallcap>.—Notwithstanding any other law (including those restricting the occupancy of housing facilities under the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States by members, and their dependents, of the armed forces above specified grades, or by members, and their dependents, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Public Health Service), a member of a uniformed service, and the dependents of the member, may be accepted as tenants in, and may occupy on a rental basis, any of those housing facilities, other than public quarters constructed or designated for assignment to an occupancy without charge by such a member and the dependents of the member, if any. Such a member may not, because of occupancy under this subsection, be deprived of any money allowance to which the member is otherwise entitled for the rental of quarters.</p>

The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall establish the threshold percentage, except that the threshold percentage may not be less than 8 percent. The administering Secretaries shall prescribe a higher threshold percentage to be applied for a fiscal year when it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the total amount of the payments of the cost-of-living allowance made to members of the uniformed services under this section for such fiscal year does not exceed the total amount available to all uniformed services for that fiscal year for paying such allowance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitation to One Allowance</cap-smallcap>.—If primary dependents of a member reside separately in different high cost areas—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member may be paid only one cost-of-living allowance under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the cost-of-living allowance payable to the member shall be the highest of the amounts computed under this section for such high cost areas.</p>

For purposes of this subsection, spendable income is the total amount of regular military compensation that is available for purchase of goods and services after allocation of amounts for taxes, insurance, housing, gifts and contributions, and savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Joint Regulations</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary of Defense and the other administering Secretaries shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Other Definitions</cap-smallcap>.—In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term “primary dependent”, with respect to a member, means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the member's spouse; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, when dependents of members of the uniformed services are authorized or ordered to depart by competent authority, they may be authorized such allowances as the Secretary concerned determines necessary to offset the expenses incident to the departure. Allowances authorized by this section are in addition to those authorized by any other section of this title. Such allowances may be paid in advance. For the purposes of this section, a dependent “authorized or ordered to depart by competent authority” includes—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a dependent who is present at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station when the departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority and who actually moved to an authorized safe haven designated by that authority, whether such safe haven is at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station or elsewhere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a dependent who resides at or in the vicinity of a former duty station of the member following the assignment of the member elsewhere or who resides at or in the vicinity of a duty station (other than the duty station of the member) incident to orders in connection with an unaccompanied tour of duty of the member, if a departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority from the duty station at which or in the vicinity of which the dependent resides and the dependent actually moves to an authorized safe haven designated by that authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a dependent who established a household at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station but who is temporarily absent therefrom for any reason when departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a dependent who was authorized to join the member and who departed from his former place of residence incident to joining the member but who, as a result of the departure of dependents, is diverted to a safe haven designated by competent authority or is authorized to travel to a place the dependent may designate, even though he was in the United States when the departure was authorized or ordered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, each member whose dependents are covered by subsection (a) is entitled to have one motor vehicle that is owned by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of the member or his dependents, transported at the expense of the United States to a designated place for the use of the dependents. When the dependents are permitted to rejoin the member, the vehicle may be transported at the expense of the United States to his permanent duty station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under paragraph (1) does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the member for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use. The amount reimbursed may not exceed $30 per day, and the rental period for which reimbursement may be provided expires after 7 days or on the date on which the delayed vehicle arrives at the authorized destination (whichever occurs first).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D) In connection with the change of temporary or permanent station of a member in a pay grade below pay grade O–6, the Secretary concerned may authorize a higher weight allowance than the weight allowance determined under subparagraph (C) for the member if the Secretary concerned determines that the application of the weight allowance determined under such subparagraph would result in significant hardship to the member or the dependents of the member. An increase in weight allowance under this subparagraph may not result in a weight allowance exceeding the weight allowance specified in subparagraph (C) for pay grades O–6 to O–10, unless the additional weight allowance in excess of such maximum is intended to permit the shipping of consumables that cannot be reasonably obtained at the new station of the member. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation for the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy, and midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy shall be entitled, in connection with temporary or permanent station change, to transportation of baggage and household effects as provided in subparagraph (A). The weight allowance for cadets and midshipmen is 350 pounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) A member entitled to transportation of baggage and household effects under subparagraph (A) may, as an alternative to the provision of transportation, be paid reimbursement or, at the member's request, a monetary allowance in advance for the cost of transportation of the baggage and household effects. The monetary allowance may be paid only if the amount of the allowance does not exceed the cost that would be incurred by the Government under subparagraph (A) for the transportation of the baggage and household effects. Appropriations available to the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Health and Human Services for providing transportation of baggage or household effects of members of the uniformed services shall be available to pay a reimbursement or monetary allowance under this subparagraph. The Secretary concerned may prescribe the manner in which the risk of liability for damage, destruction, or loss of baggage or household effects arranged, packed, crated, or loaded by a member is allocated among the member, the United States, and any contractor when a reimbursement or monetary allowance is elected under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned may pay a member a share (determined pursuant to such regulations) of the savings resulting to the United States when the total weights of the member's baggage and household effects shipped and stored under subparagraph (A) are less than the average weights of the baggage and household effects that are shipped and stored, respectively, by other members in the same grade and with the same dependents status as the member in connection with changes of station that are comparable to the member's change of station. The total savings shall be equal to the difference between the cost of shipping and cost of storing such average weights of baggage and household effects, respectively, and the corresponding costs associated with the weights of the member's baggage and household effects. For the administration of this subparagraph, the Secretary of Defense shall annually determine the average weights of baggage and household effects shipped and stored in connection with a change of temporary or permanent station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The transportation and allowances authorized under paragraph (1) may be paid or provided to a member upon his separation from the service or release from active duty only if the member applies for the transportation and allowances not later than 180 days after the date of his separation or release from active duty. If a member to whom this paragraph applies has been authorized nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the 180-day period shall not begin until such authorization for nontemporary storage expires. This paragraph does not apply to a member to whom subsection (g)(1) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The allowances and transportation authorized by subsections (a) and (b) are in addition to those authorized by sections 403(c), 404, and 405 of this title and are—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subject to such conditions and limitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for such grades, ranks, and ratings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to and from such places;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">prescribed by the Secretaries concerned. Transportation of the household effects of a member may not be made by commercial air carrier at an estimated over-all cost that is more than the estimated over-all cost of the transportation thereof by other means, unless an appropriate transportation officer has certified in writing to his commanding officer that those household effects to be so transported are necessary for use in carrying out assigned duties, or are necessary to prevent undue hardship and other means of transportation will not fill those needs. However, not more than 1,000 pounds of unaccompanied baggage may be transported by commercial air carrier, without regard to the preceding sentence, under regulations prescribed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may be authorized in facilities of the United States, or in commercial facilities when it is considered to be more economical to the United States. However, the weight of baggage and household effects stored, plus the weight of the baggage and household effects transported, in connection with a change of station may not be more than the maximum weight limitations in regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned when it is not otherwise fixed by law. In the event a member's baggage and household effects exceed such maximum weight limitation, the Secretary concerned, if requested to do so by the member, may pay the costs for the nontemporary storage of that excess weight and collect the amount paid from the member's pay and allowances, or collect the amount in such other manner as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate. The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may not be authorized for a period longer than one year from the date the member concerned is separated from the service, retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, discharged, or released from active duty, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned for a member who, on that date, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment; or in the case of a member who—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except in the case of a member who, on the date of his separation, discharge, or release, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment, the cost of the storage, for the period that exceeds one year, shall be paid by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of his dependents, baggage, and household effects, the Secretaries concerned may authorize the movement of the dependents, baggage, and household effects and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof (as the case may be), plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b). This subsection may be used only under unusual or emergency circumstances, including those in which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member is performing duty at a place designated by the Secretary concerned as being within a zone from which dependents should be evacuated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) orders which direct the member's travel in connection with temporary duty do not provide for return to the permanent station or do not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from his permanent station; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is involuntarily separated from active duty during the period beginning on October 1, 1990, and ending on December 31, 2001,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is, not later than one year from the date he is so retired, placed on that list, involuntarily separated, discharged, or released, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned, entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects to the home selected under section 404(c) of this title, and to a per diem for his dependents. In addition, baggage and household effects may be shipped to a location other than the home selected by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If baggage and household effects of a member are shipped to a place selected by a member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title or to a location other than the home selected by the member, or if transportation is provided for a member's dependents to a place selected by the member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title, and the costs of that shipment or transportation are in excess of those that would have been incurred if the shipment had been made or the transportation had been provided to a location in the United States (other than Alaska or Hawaii), the member shall pay that excess cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a member authorized to select a home under section 404(c) of this title accrues that right or any entitlement under this subsection but dies before he exercises it, that right or entitlement accrues to and may be exercised by his surviving dependents or, if there are no surviving dependents, his baggage and household effects may be shipped to the home of the person legally entitled to such baggage and effects. However, if baggage and household effects are shipped under circumstances described in paragraph (2) in which the member would have been required to pay the excess costs of that shipment, the surviving dependents or the person legally entitled to the baggage and household effects, as the case may be, shall pay that excess cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) If the Secretary concerned determines that it is in the best interests of a member described in paragraph (2) or the member's dependents and the United States, the Secretary may, when orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) authorize the movement of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects at the station to an appropriate location in the United States or its possessions or, if the dependents are foreign nationals, to the country of the dependents’ origin and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof, as the case may be, plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a member described in paragraph (2)(A), authorize the transportation of one motor vehicle, which is owned or leased by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of a dependent of the member, to that location by means of transportation authorized under section 2634 of title 10 or authorize the storage of the motor vehicle pursuant to subsection (b) of such section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the member's baggage and household effects are in nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may authorize their movement to the location concerned and prescribe transportation in kind or reimbursement therefor, as authorized under subsection (b). For the purposes of this section, a member's unmarried child for whom the member received transportation in kind to his station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof and who, by reason of age or graduation from (or cessation of enrollment in) an institution of higher education, would otherwise cease to be a dependent of the member while the member was serving at that station shall still be considered as a dependent of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member referred to in paragraph (1) is a member who—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is serving at a station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) receives an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is sentenced by a court-martial—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to be confined for a period of more than 30 days,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to receive a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) to be dismissed from a uniformed service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under this subsection does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the member for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use. The amount reimbursed may not exceed $30 per day, and the rental period for which reimbursement may be provided expires after 7 days or on the date on which the delayed vehicle arrives at the authorized destination (whichever occurs first).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A member traveling under orders who is relieved from a duty station is entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, regardless of the time the dependents, baggage, or household effects arrive at their destination. Appropriations of the Department of Defense available for travel or transportation that are current when the member is relieved may be used to pay for the transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member with dependents who is ordered to make an overseas permanent change of station and who, in anticipation of his dependents accompanying him overseas, ships baggage and household effects to that overseas station, may be authorized a return shipment of the baggage and household effects if, after the shipment, the member's dependents are unable to accompany him overseas and the Secretary concerned determines that such inability was unexpected and uncontrollable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) For the purposes of this section, the residence of a dependent of a member who is a student not living with the member while at school shall be considered to be the permanent duty station of the member or the designated residence of dependents of the member if the member's dependents are not authorized to reside with the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) No carrier, port agent, warehouseman, freight forwarder, or other person involved in the transportation of property may have any lien on, or hold, impound, or otherwise interfere with, the movement of baggage and household goods being transported under this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words “Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section,” are inserted for clarity.

(See section 243 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 492).) The words “of the Army, or the Air Force, without specification of component” are inserted to reflect the definition of “reserve component” in section 102(k) of the source statute. That definition is executed throughout this revised title. For that reason, the words “but not as a member of the Army without specification of component or the Air Force without specification of component, in section 255(a)(2) of existing title 37”, are omitted, and since those categories are excluded by the words “member of a reserve component”.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, “household and personal effects” and “household effects” may include, in addition to other authorized weight allowances, one privately owned motor vehicle which may be shipped at United States expense. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, and in place of the transportation of household and personal effects, a dependent, who would otherwise be entitled to transportation of household and personal effects under this section, may transport a house trailer or mobile dwelling within and between the areas specified in section 409 of this title for use as a residence by one of the following means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) transport it and be reimbursed by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) deliver it to an agent of the United States for transportation by the United States or by commercial means; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have it transported by commercial means, and be reimbursed by the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If a trailer or dwelling is transported under clause (2) or (3), that transportation may include one privately owned motor vehicle which may be shipped at United States expense. Transportation, and incidental costs, authorized by this section shall be at United States expense without any cost limitation, and any payment authorized may be made in advance of the transportation concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking of household and personal effects) may be provided for the dependents and household and personal effects of a member of a uniformed service on active duty (without regard to pay grade) who is officially reported as dead, injured, ill, or absent for a period of more than 29 days in a missing status—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the member's official residence of record;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the residence of his dependent, next of kin, or other person entitled to custody of the effects, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) on request of the member (if injured or ill), or his dependent, next of kin, or other person described in clause (2), to another location determined in advance or later approved by the Secretary concerned, or his designee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">When he considers it necessary, the Secretary concerned may, with respect to the household and personal effects of a member who is officially reported as absent for a period of more than 29 days in a missing status, authorize the nontemporary storage of those effects for a period of one year, or longer when justified. In addition, he may authorize additional movements of, and prescribe transportation for, the dependents and household and personal effects, or the dependents and house trailer or mobile dwelling, of a member who is officially reported as absent for a period of more than one year in a missing status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a member described in subsection (b) is in an injured or ill status, transportation of dependents and household and personal effects authorized by this section may be provided only when prolonged hospitalization or treatment is anticipated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Transportation requested by a dependent may be authorized under this section only if there is a reasonable relationship between the circumstances of the dependent and the requested destination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In place of the transportation for dependents authorized by this section, and after the travel is completed, the Secretary concerned may authorize—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reimbursement for the commercial cost of the transportation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a monetary allowance at the prescribed rate for all, or that part, of the travel for which transportation in kind is not furnished.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary concerned may store the household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b) until proper disposition can be made. The cost of the storage and transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking) of household and personal effects shall be charged against appropriations currently available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary concerned may, when he determines that there is an emergency and a sale would be in the best interests of the United States, provide for the public or private sale of motor vehicles and other bulky items of household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b). Before a sale, and if practicable, a reasonable effort shall be made to determine the desires of the interested persons. The net proceeds received from the sale shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, be sent to the owner or other persons. If there are no such persons, or if they or their addresses are not known within one year from the date of sale, the net proceeds may be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Claims for net proceeds that are covered into the Treasury under subsection (g) may be filed with the Secretary of Defense by the rightful owners, their heirs or next of kin, or their legal representatives at any time before the end of a 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury. When a claim is filed, the Secretary of Defense shall allow or disallow it. A claim that is allowed shall be paid from the appropriation for refunding money erroneously received and covered. If a claim is not filed before the end of the 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury, it is barred from being acted on by the courts or the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under this section does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the dependent for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may make any determination necessary to administer this chapter and, when so made, it is conclusive as to—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the fact of dependency under this chapter;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraphs (1), (5), (6), and (7) only apply with respect to a case to which section 555 of this title applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the Secretary concerned, in a case to which section 555 of this title applies, receives information that he considers establishes conclusively the death of a member of a uniformed service, he shall, notwithstanding any earlier action relating to death or other status of the member, act on it as an official report of death. After the end of the 12-month period in a missing status prescribed by section 555 of this title, the Secretary concerned, or his designee, shall, when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that a member in a missing status is dead, make a finding of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may determine the entitlement of a member to pay and allowances under this chapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive. An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that a member captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may, when warranted by the circumstances, reconsider a determination made under this chapter, and change or modify it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the account of a member has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this chapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the member if the Secretary concerned, or his designee, determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the member was not a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from pay and allowances of a member for the period he is entitled to pay and allowances under section 552 of this title may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when it was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death. An allotment payment for a period after the end of entitlement to pay and allowances under this chapter, or otherwise, which was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death, may not be collected from the allottee or charged against the pay of the deceased member.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term “captive status” means a missing status of a member of the uniformed services which, as determined by the President, arises because of a hostile action and is a result of membership in the uniformed services, but does not include a period of captivity of a member as a prisoner of war if Congress provides to such member, in an Act enacted after August 27, 1986, monetary payment in respect of such period of captivity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term “former captive” means a person who, as a member of the uniformed services, was held in a captive status.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish a savings fund to which the Secretary concerned may allot all or any portion of the pay and allowances of any member of the uniformed services who is in a captive status to the extent that such pay and allowances are not subject to an allotment under section 553 of this title or any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts so allotted shall bear interest at a rate which, for any calendar quarter, shall be equal to the average rate paid on United States Treasury bills with three-month maturities issued during the preceding calendar quarter. Such interest shall be computed quarterly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amounts in the savings fund credited to a member shall be considered as pay and allowances for purposes of section 553(c) of this title and shall otherwise be subject to withdrawal under procedures which the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any interest accruing under this subsection on—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any amount for which a member is indebted to the United States under section 552(c) of this title shall be deemed to be part of the amount due under such section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any amount referred to in section 556(f) of this title shall be deemed to be part of such amount for purposes of such section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An allotment under this subsection may be made without regard to section 553(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the President shall make a cash payment to any person who is a former captive. Such payment shall be made before the end of the one-year period beginning on the date on which the captive status of such person terminates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in section 802 of the Victims of Terrorism Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 5569 note), the amount of such payment shall be determined by the President under the provisions of section 5569(d)(2) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The President—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) may defer such payment in the case of any former captive who during such one-year period is charged with an offense described in clause (ii), until final disposition of such charge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) may deny such payment in the case of any former captive who is convicted of a captivity-related offense—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) referred to in subsection (b) or (c) of section 8312 of title 5; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) under chapter 47 of title 10 (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) that is punishable by dishonorable discharge, dismissal, or confinement for one year or more.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), a captivity-related offense is an offense that is—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) committed by a person while the person is in a captive status; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) related to the captive status of the person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A payment under this subsection is in addition to any other amount provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any amount due a person under this subsection shall, after the death of such person, be deemed to be pay and allowances for the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any payment made under paragraph (1) that is later denied under paragraph (3)(A)(ii) is a claim of the United States Government for purposes of section 3711 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A determination by the President under subsection (a)(1) or (c) is final and is not subject to judicial review.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service may be paid in advance—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not more than three months’ pay of such member upon such member's change of permanent station; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of an allotment made from such member's pay to a dependent if such member is assigned or scheduled for assignment to sea duty or other duty with a unit or command deployed or to be deployed outside the United States and the allotment is made by such member not more than sixty days before the scheduled date of the assignment of such member to such duty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service who is on duty at a distant station where the pay and emoluments to which he is entitled cannot be disbursed regularly, may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an advance of pay to a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside the United States, or other place designated by the Secretary of Defense, of not more than two months’ basic pay may be made to a member if the member or the dependents of the member are ordered evacuated by competent authority. An advance of pay under this subsection is not subject to the conditions under which advances of pay may be made under subsection (a) or (b). An advance may be made on the basis of the evacuation of a member's dependents only if all dependents of members of the uniformed services are ordered evacuated from the place where the member's dependents are located. In the case of a member with dependents, the payment may be made directly to dependents previously designated by the member. The Secretary concerned or his designee may waive any right of recovery of not more than one month's basic pay advanced under this subsection if he finds that recovery of the advance would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If a person to whom an advance of pay is made under subsection (a), (b), or (c) dies or is separated from his uniformed service, before liquidation of that advance, the amount re maining unliquidated at the time of his death or separation shall be credited to the account of the disbursing officer concerned. However, the unliquidated amount remains a debt of that person or his estate to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) As far as practicable, regulations for the administration of subsections (a)–(d) shall be uniform for all of the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an obligation for an advance of pay made pursuant to this section shall be recorded as an obligation only in the fiscal year in which the entitlement of the member to the pay accrues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Current appropriations available for advance payments under this section may be transferred to the prior fiscal year appropriation available for the same purpose in the amount of any unliquidated advance payments that remain at the end of such prior fiscal year. Such unliquidated advance payments shall then be credited to the current appropriation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, an advance of pay of not more than three months’ pay may be made to an officer of the Coast Guard who is ordered to sea duty or to or from shore duty beyond the seas. In addition, the Commandant of the Coast Guard may direct such advances as he considers necessary and proper to members of the Coast Guard stationed at distant stations where the pay and emoluments to which they are entitled cannot be paid regularly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the dislocation allowance authorized by section 407 of this title for a member of a uniformed service whose dependents are covered by section 405a(a) of this title may be paid in advance of the evacuation of the dependents and to the dependents designated by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of section 3324 of title 31, the Secretary concerned may, when the last day of the pay period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, authorize the payment of pay and allowances to members of uniformed service under his jurisdiction on the preceding workday but not more than three days before the last day of that pay period. If a member dies after he has received an advance payment under this subsection, but before the last day of the pay period for which the payment is made, no part of the amount so advance is recoverable by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program upon reporting for a period of active duty required by section 2121(c) of title 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps who is ordered to field training or a practice required under section 2109 of title 10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an amount that a member of the uniformed services is administratively determined to owe the United States or any of its instrumentalities may be deducted from his pay in monthly installments.

<p class="statutory-body">(f) If, upon final settlement of the accounts of an officer of the Army or the Air Force charged with the issue of an article of military supply, there is a deficiency of that article, or if an article of military supply with whose issue an officer is charged is damaged, the value of the lost article or the amount of the damage shall be charged against the officer and deducted from his monthly pay, unless he shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force, as the case may be, by one or more affidavits setting forth the circumstances, that he was not at fault.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) An amount due the United States from an officer of the Army or the Air Force for rations bought on credit, and for articles bought on credit under section 4621(a)(1) or 9621(a)(1) of title 10, shall be deducted from the next pay due that officer after the sale is reported.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this subsection, the term “service relief society” means the Army Emergency Relief, the Air Force Aid Society, the Navy Relief Society, or the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance.</p>
