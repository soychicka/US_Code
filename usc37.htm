<p class="note-body">The definitions in clauses (1) and (2), (6)–(10), (14)–(21), and (24) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this revised title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used, and so far as possible are identical to those used in title 10, United States Code, containing most of the basic law relating to the armed forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (3), the words "and all Regular and Reserve components thereof", in section 231(a) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage. Section 231(j) of existing title 37 is omitted as covered by section 1 of title 1.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4), that part of section 32(a) of existing title 37 relating other than to the enumeration of the armed forces is omitted as unnecessary. Section 231(k) of existing title 37 is omitted, since throughout the revised title references to members of the Army or Air Force without specification of component are specifically included when necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (11), the words "flight officer" are omitted as obsolete. Section 231(c) (last sentence) of existing title 37 is omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12), the definition of commissioned officer is broadened and restated to conform to the definition in section 101(15) of title 10. Corresponding changes are made throughout the revised title to correspond to the definition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (13), which is identical to section 101(16) of title 10, is substituted for section 231(e) of existing title 37. The words "flight officer" are omitted as obsolete. Section 231(h) of existing title 37 is omitted, since the defined term is not used in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (22) is substituted for section 231(i) of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (23), section 231(b) (less 1st sentence) of existing title 37 is omitted as executed by the express coverage of members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words "whether under temporary or permanent appointment" are omitted as surplusage. The words "the following pay grades" are substituted for the words "the various pay grades prescribed for commissioned officers by subsection (a) of this section, as follows". The words "(other than a commissioned warrant officer)" are inserted to conform to the definition of "warrant officer" in section 101(13) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words "with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title" are substituted for the word "minimum".</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c) and (e), the words "with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title" are substituted for the words "with under two cumulative years&apos; service" and "with under two cumulative years of service", in sections 308 and 232(e), respectively, of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words "enlisted or appointed under the Army Aviation Cadet Act, as amended, or under the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942, as amended" are omitted as obsolete and surplusage. Both of the cited acts were repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and replaced by various sections of title 10. Further reference is surplusage, however, since aviation cadets are not appointed or enlisted under any provision of law other than the sections of title 10 embodying the former Army Aviation Cadet Act and the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942. The word "basic" is inserted for clarity, since the word "pay" as defined in section 101(21) of this revised title includes special and incentive pays. Incentive pay for aviation cadets is provided in section 301(b) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words "While on active duty", in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14, are omitted as covered by section 204 of this title which prescribes the conditions under which members of the uniformed services are entitled to basic pay. The words "Unless he is entitled to the basic pay of a higher pay grade" are substituted for the words "or that of his grade, whichever is greater" in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words "Except as provided by subsections (e) and (f)" are inserted to reflect those subsections relating to enlisted aviation cadets or aviation pilots.</p>

<p class="note-body">[The citations to section 232(d) of existing title 37, above, are to the language of subsection (d) set forth in the codification note under section 232, rather than that erroneously set forth in the text of the section.]</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the last 27 words are substituted for the words "or performance of the duties provided for by sections 5, 81, 94, 97 and 99 of the National Defense Act, as amended," to reflect the current citations. So much of the introductory clause as follows the exception is substituted for the 36 words preceding 1st proviso of 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37. The words "on the active list" are omitted as covered by the words "active duty" as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title. The words "(provided for or authorized in the National Defense Act, as amended, or in the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, as amended)" are omitted as covered by the words "provided by law".</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words "For the purposes of subsection (a)" are inserted for clarity. The words "active duty for a period of more than 30 days" are substituted for the words "extended active duty in excess of thirty days". The words "call or" are inserted to conform to the words "called or".</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words "and allowances" are omitted, since, under chapter 7 of this revised title, entitlement to allowances depends upon entitlement to basic pay. The last sentence is substituted for the last 38 words of the 2d proviso of the 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words "for the purposes of this section" are substituted for the words "and which entitles them to receive basic pay . . . in the service of the United States". The words "pursuant to this section" are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words "or active duty for training" are omitted as covered by the words "active duty" as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words "is appointed" are substituted for the words "has been or may be commissioned". The words "under the laws appointing such graduates to the Army" and the last 16 words of section 308a of existing title 37 are omitted as surplusage. The words "to the date of his acceptance of and qualification under his commission" are omitted, since the member concerned would continue to be entitled to basic pay after that acceptance and qualification. The words "or the United States Naval Academy" are inserted to reflect section 541 of title 10, under which graduates of that Academy may be appointed in the Army or the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), the inclusion of the Coast Guard Reserve is based on the authority contained in section 755(c) of title 14.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the introductory clause is substituted for section 233(a) (introductory clause) of existing title 37. In clauses (1) and (2), the word "officer" is substituted for the words "commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, warrant officer" to conform to the definition of "officer" in section 101(11) of this revised title. In clause (1), the words "Regular or Reserve component" are omitted, since, under the definition of "reserve component" in section 102(k) of the source statute, those words are defined to include members without component status. Together, these categories compose the entire structure of any uniformed service. In clause (2)(F), the words "a reserve component of a uniformed service" are substituted for the words "the National Guard of the United States, or in the Organized Reserve Corps, or in the Officers&apos; Reserve Corps, or in the Enlisted Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Navy, or in the Dental Reserve Corps of the Navy . . . or in the Naval Reserve . . . or in the Air National Guard of the United States, or in the Air Force Reserve, or in the officers&apos; section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the enlisted section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the Air Corps Reserve . . . or in the Marine Corps Reserve, or in the Coast Guard Reserve, or in the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service," since all of the named organizations were or are reserve components. In clause (4), the words "as it existed at any time before April 16, 1947" are inserted for clarity, since the reference is intended to apply to the corps established by law before April 16, 1947. Service in the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps now existing would be included under clause (1) or (2), since there is now no legal distinction between the service of nurses and that of other members of the Army and Navy. In clause (6), the date "January 1, 1961," is substituted for the words "the effective date of this section," to reflect laws enacted after that effective date which authorized certain service to be credited for pay purposes. See, for example, Public Law 86–142. Clause (9) is substituted for section 233(b) (less proviso) of existing title 37. The last sentence is substituted for section 233(b) (proviso) of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the first 33 words of section 233(d) of existing title 37 are omitted as covered by the words "are computed by adding" in subsection (a). The words "for any reason," in section 233(d) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(3), the words "chapter 67 of title 10" are substituted for the words "title III of the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act of 1948," since that title was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and is now codified as chapter 67 of title 10 by section 1 of that Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of incentive pay for any hazardous duty described in subsection (a).</p>

If the sum of units determined under the preceding sentence equals or exceeds the minimum standard prescribed by the President for entitlement to pay specified under subsections (b) and (c) for a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire relevant month, the member shall be entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c) for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire month.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words preceding the tables are substituted for section 235(b) (words preceding tables) of existing title 37. The words "Years of service computed under section 205" are inserted in the tables for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words "a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard" are substituted for the enumeration of the organizations concerned in section 301(d) of existing title 37. The words "when . . . performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a)(1)–(11) for members entitled to basic pay" are substituted for the words "when required by competent orders to perform any hazardous duty prescribed by or pursuant to section 235 of this title for members of the uniformed services entitled to receive basic pay and when in consequence of such orders they do perform any hazardous duty so prescribed". The last sentence is substituted for section 301(e) (as applicable to (d)) of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words "entitled to incentive pay under section 301(a)(1) of this title" are substituted for the words "flight pay". At the time of the enactment of the source statute, additional pay was authorized as "flight pay". However, the Career Compensation Act of 1949 did not authorize "flight pay" but provided incentive pay in section 204(a)(1) [now section 301(a)(1) of this revised title] for "duty as a crew member . . . involving frequent and regular participation in aerial flight". The words "before January 2 of each year" are substituted for the words "On or before January 1, annually". The word "grade" is substituted for the word "rank" to conform to the definition in section 101(15) of this revised title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is also entitled to aviation career incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational or proficiency flying duty required by orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Aviation career incentive pay shall be restricted to regular and reserve officers who hold, or are in training leading to, an aeronautical rating or designation and who engage and remain in aviation service on a career basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, or the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to members under their respective jurisdiction, an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) that is applicable to him. A flight surgeon or other medical officer who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is not entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay but is entitled to monthly incentive pay in the amounts set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational flying duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) To be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay, an officer must perform the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for 8 of the first 12, and 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer. However, if an officer performs the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for at least 10 but less than 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer, the officer will be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay for the first 22 years of aviation service of the officer. Entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases for an officer (other than a warrant officer) upon completion of 25 years of aviation service, but such an officer in a pay grade below pay grade O–7 remains entitled to monthly incentive pay under subsection (b)(1) for the performance of operational flying duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service it is determined that an officer has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases. For the needs of the service, the Secretary concerned may permit, on a case by case basis, an officer to continue to receive continuous monthly incentive pay despite the failure of the officer to perform the prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time so long as the officer has performed those requirements for not less than 6 years of aviation service. The Secretary concerned may not delegate the authority in the preceding sentence to permit the payment of incentive pay under this subsection. If at the completion of 12 years of aviation service entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases, entitlement to that pay may again commence at the completion of 18 years of aviation service upon completion of the minimum operational flying duty requirements, such pay to continue for a period of time as prescribed in accordance with this section. However, if entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases in the case of any officer at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service, such officer remains entitled to monthly incentive pay for the performance of subsequent operational or proficiency flying duties up to the maximum period of time prescribed in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term "aviation service" means service performed by an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) while holding an aeronautical rating or designation or while in training to receive an aeronautical rating or designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term "operational flying duty" means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying skills normally are maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the Secretary concerned, and flying performed by members in training that leads to the award of an aeronautical rating or designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term "proficiency flying duty" means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which such skills would normally not be maintained in the performance of assigned duties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The term "officer" includes an individual enlisted, and designated, as an aviation cadet under section 8411 of title 10.</p>

Such member is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility Requirements</cap-smallcap>.—(1) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of the naval service who is entitled to basic pay, and (A) holds (or is in training leading to) a submarine duty designator, (B) is in and remains in the submarine service on a career basis, and (C) meets the requirements of paragraph (3), is entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay in the amount prescribed pursuant to subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to regulations prescribed by the President, a member of the naval service who is entitled to basic pay but is not entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay under paragraph (1) is entitled to submarine duty incentive pay in the amount prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) for any period during which such member performs frequent and regular operational submarine duty (as defined in paragraph (5)) required by orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To be entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay through 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), a member must perform operational submarine duties for at least 6 of the first 12, and at least 10 of the first 18, years of his submarine service. However, if a member performs the prescribed operational submarine duties for at least 8 but less than 10 of the first 18 years of his submarine service, he is entitled to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay for the first 22 years of his service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 years of submarine service it is determined that a member has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational submarine duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases. If entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases upon completion of 12 years of submarine service, entitlement to that pay may again commence upon completion of 18 years of submarine service if the minimum operational submarine duty requirements have been met, and such pay shall continue for the period of time prescribed in accordance with this section. However, if entitlement to continuous monthly submarine duty incentive pay ceases in the case of any member at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of submarine service or 26 years of service (as computed under section 205 of this title, but excluding, in the case of an officer, periods as an enlisted member before initial appointment as an officer), such member shall be entitled to that pay in the amount prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) for the performance of subsequent operational submarine duty, or for the performance of service as a member of a submarine operational command staff, if such member's duties require serving on a submarine during underway operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term "operational submarine duty" means duty—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) while attached under competent orders to a submarine, while serving as an operator or crew member of an operational submersible (including an undersea exploration or research vehicle), while undergoing training preliminary to assignment to a nuclear-powered submarine, while undergoing rehabilitation after assignment to a nuclear-powered submarine, or, in the case of a member qualified in submarines, while attached as a member of a submarine operational command staff whose duties require serving on a submarine during underway operations—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) during one calendar month: 48 hours, except that hours served underway in excess of 48 as a member of a submarine operational command staff during any of the immediately preceding five calendar months and not already used to qualify for incentive pay may be applied to satisfy the underway time requirements for the current month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) during any two consecutive calendar months when the requirements of subclause (I) of this clause have not been met: 96 hours; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) during any three consecutive calendar months when the requirements of subclause (II) of this clause have not been met: 144 hours;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) while receiving instruction to prepare for assignment to a submarine of advanced design, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) while receiving instruction to prepare for a position of increased responsibility on a submarine.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term "submarine service" means the service performed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy, by a member, and the years of submarine service are computed beginning with the effective date of the initial order to perform submarine service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Monthly Rates</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary of the Navy shall prescribe the monthly rates of submarine duty incentive pay, except that the maximum monthly rate may not exceed $1,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.—(1) An officer who fails of selection for assignment as an executive officer or commanding officer of a submarine or who declines to serve in either such position may not be paid submarine duty incentive pay except for periods during which the officer is serving on a submarine during underway operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An enlisted member may not be paid continuous submarine duty incentive pay while serving ashore between submarine sea duty assignments unless the member has a sufficient period of enlistment (including any extension of an enlistment) remaining to be reassigned to submarine sea duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Applicability to Certain Navy Reserve Duty</cap-smallcap>.—Under regulations prescribed by the President and to the extent provided for by appropriations, when a member of the Navy Reserve who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, performs, under orders, duty on a submarine during underway operations, he is eligible for an increase in such compensation equal to one-thirtieth of the monthly incentive pay prescribed pursuant to subsection (b) for the performance of that duty by a member of a corresponding grade and years of service who is entitled to basic pay. Such a member is eligible for the increase for each day served, for as long as he is qualified for it, during each regular period of appropriate duty.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A commissioned medical officer in the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service (other than an officer serving in the Indian Health Service) may not receive additional special pay under section 302(a)(4) of this title for any period during which the officer is providing obligated service under the following provisions of law:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Special Pay Authorized; Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.—Under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary may pay special pay under subsection (b) to an officer of the naval service who—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is entitled to basic pay;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has the current technical qualification for duty in connection with supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion plants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) executes a written agreement to remain on active duty in connection with supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion plants for a period of not less than three years, so long as the new period of obligated active service does not extend beyond the end of 30 years of commissioned service, in addition to any other period of obligated active service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Payment Amount; Payment Options</cap-smallcap>.—(1) The total amount paid to an officer under an agreement under subsection (a) or (e)(1) may not exceed $30,000 for each year of the active-service agreement. Amounts paid under the agreement are in addition to all other compensation to which the officer is entitled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall determine annually the necessity for continuance of the special pay and the rate of special pay per year for such active-service agreements accepted within each 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon acceptance of an agreement under subsection (a) or (e)(1) by the Secretary, the total amount payable shall be paid in a single lump-sum or in annual installments of equal or different amounts over the length of the contract, commencing at the expiration of any existing period of obligated active service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may accept an active service agreement under this section not more than one year in advance of the end of an officer's existing period of obligated active service under such an agreement. In such a case, the amount of the special pay may be paid commencing with the date of acceptance of the agreement, and, if the special pay will be paid in annual installments, the number of installments may not exceed the number of years covered by the agreement plus one.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Repayment</cap-smallcap>.—An officer who does not complete the period of active duty in connection with the supervision, operation, and maintenance of naval nuclear propulsion plants that the officer agreed to serve, and for which a payment was made under subsection (b) or (e)(1), shall be subject to the repayment provisions of section 303a(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Relation to Service Obligation</cap-smallcap>.—Nothing in this section shall alter or modify the obligation of a regular officer to perform active service at the pleasure of the President.

The period of such an agreement shall be a period equal to or exceeding the original period of the officer's existing agreement, so long as the period of obligated active service under the new agreement does not extend beyond the maximum number of years of commissioned service authorized by subsection (a)(3). If a new agreement is executed under this subsection, the existing active-service agreement shall be cancelled, effective on the day before an anniversary date of that agreement after the date on which the amount that may be paid under this section is increased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection shall be carried out under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Duration of Authority</cap-smallcap>.—The provisions of this section shall be effective only in the case of officers who, on or before December 31, 2018, execute the required written agreement to remain in active service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title, or is entitled to pay under section 206 of this title as described in subsection (e) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) holds an enlisted military occupational specialty or enlisted military rating designated as a career enlisted flyer specialty or rating by the Secretary concerned, performs duty as a dropsonde system operator, or is in training leading to qualification and designation of such a specialty or rating or the performance of such duty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) satisfies the operational flying duty requirements applicable under subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Incentive Pay Authorized</cap-smallcap>.—(1) The Secretary concerned may pay monthly incentive pay to an eligible career enlisted flyer in an amount not to exceed the monthly maximum amounts specified in subsection (d).

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Continuous monthly incentive pay may not be paid to an eligible career enlisted flyer after the member completes 25 years of aviation service. Thereafter, an eligible career enlisted flyer may still receive incentive pay on a month-to-month basis under subsection (c)(4) for the frequent and regular performance of operational flying duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Operational Flying Duty Requirements</cap-smallcap>.—(1) An eligible career enlisted flyer must perform operational flying duties for 6 of the first 10, 9 of the first 15, and 14 of the first 20 years of aviation service, to be eligible for continuous monthly incentive pay under this section.</p>

Payment of continuous monthly incentive pay may be resumed if the member meets the minimum operational flying duty requirement upon completion of the next established period of aviation service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the needs of the service, the Secretary concerned may permit, on a case-by-case basis, a member to continue to receive continuous monthly incentive pay despite the member's failure to perform the operational flying duty required during the first 10, 15, or 20 years of aviation service, but only if the member otherwise meets the definition in subsection (a) and has performed at least 5 years of operational flying duties during the first 10 years of aviation service, 8 years of operational flying duties during the first 15 years of aviation service, or 12 years of operational flying duty during the first 20 years of aviation service.

The rate payable is the same rate authorized by the Secretary concerned under subsection (d) for a member of corresponding years of aviation service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Monthly Maximum Rates</cap-smallcap>.—The monthly rate of any career enlisted flyer incentive pay paid under this section to a member on active duty shall be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, but may not exceed the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility of Reserve Component Members When Performing Inactive Duty Training</cap-smallcap>.—Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, when a member of a reserve component or the National Guard, who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, meets the definition of eligible career enlisted flyer, the Secretary concerned may increase the member's compensation by an amount equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by the Secretary concerned under subsection (d) for a member of corresponding years of aviation service who is entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title. The reserve component member may receive the increase for as long as the member is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction or period of appropriate duty, at which the member is engaged for at least two hours, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Relation to Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay or Diving Duty Special Pay</cap-smallcap>.—A member receiving incentive pay under section 301(a) of this title or special pay under section 304 of this title may not be paid special pay under this section for the same period of service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Save Pay Provision</cap-smallcap>.—If, immediately before a member receives incentive pay under this section, the member was entitled to incentive pay under section 301(a) of this title, the rate at which the member is paid incentive pay under this section shall be equal to the higher of the monthly amount applicable under subsection (d) or the rate of incentive pay the member was receiving under subsection (b) or (c)(2)(A) of section 301 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Specialty Code of Dropsonde System Operators</cap-smallcap>.—Within the Air Force, the Secretary of the Air Force shall assign to members who are dropsonde system operators a specialty code that identifies such members as serving in a weather specialty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.—In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term "aviation service" means participation in aerial flight performed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, by an eligible career enlisted flyer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term "operational flying duty" means flying performed under competent orders while serving in assignments, including an assignment as a dropsonde system operator, in which basic flying skills normally are maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the Secretary concerned, and flying duty performed by members in training that leads to the award of an enlisted aviation rating or military occupational specialty designated as a career enlisted flyer rating or specialty by the Secretary concerned.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Payment of the supplemental subsistence allowance for 12 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Promotion of the member to a higher grade.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Entitlement</cap-smallcap>.—(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is entitled to a basic allowance for housing at the monthly rates prescribed under this section or another provision of law with regard to the applicable component of the basic allowance for housing. The amount of the basic allowance for housing for a member will vary according to the pay grade in which the member is assigned or distributed for basic pay purposes, the dependency status of the member, and the geographic location of the member. The basic allowance for housing may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service with dependents is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing as a member with dependents unless the member makes a certification to the Secretary concerned indicating the status of each dependent of the member. The certification shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing Inside the United States</cap-smallcap>.—(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the rates of the basic allowance for housing that are applicable for the various military housing areas in the United States. The rates for an area shall be based on the costs of adequate housing determined for the area under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall determine the costs of adequate housing in a military housing area in the United States for all members of the uniformed services entitled to a basic allowance for housing in that area. The Secretary shall base the determination upon the costs of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area. After June 30, 2001, the Secretary may not differentiate between members with dependents in pay grades E–1 through E–4 in determining what constitutes adequate housing for members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing for an area of the United States for a member of a uniformed service shall be the amount equal to the difference between—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount of the monthly cost of adequate housing in that area, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as the member; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount equal to a specified percentage (determined under subparagraph (B)) of the national average monthly cost of adequate housing in the United States, as determined by the Secretary, for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The percentage to be used for purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be determined by the Secretary of Defense and may not exceed the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) One percent for months occurring during 2015.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Two percent for months occurring during 2016.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Three percent for months occurring during 2017.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Four percent for months occurring during 2018.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Five percent for months occurring after 2018.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An adjustment in the rates of the basic allowance for housing under this subsection as a result of the Secretary's redetermination of housing costs in an area shall take effect on the same date as the effective date of the next increase in basic pay under section 1009 of this title or other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) On and after July 1, 2001, the Secretary of Defense shall establish a single monthly rate for members of the uniformed services with dependents in pay grades E–1 through E–4 in the same military housing area. The rate shall be consistent with the rates paid to members in pay grades other than pay grades E–1 through E–4 and shall be based on the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The average cost of a two-bedroom apartment in that military housing area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) One-half of the difference between the average cost of a two-bedroom townhouse in that area and the amount determined in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing within an area of the United States, the monthly amount of the allowance for the member may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Under the authority of this paragraph, the Secretary of Defense may prescribe a temporary increase in the rates of basic allowance for housing otherwise prescribed for a military housing area or a portion of a military housing area if the military housing area or portion thereof—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is located in an area covered by a declaration by the President under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170) that a major disaster exists; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) contains one or more military installations that are experiencing a sudden increase in the number of members of the armed forces assigned to the installation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Defense shall base the amount of the increase to be made in the rates of basic allowance for housing for an area on a determination by the Secretary of the amount by which the costs of adequate housing for civilians have increased in the area by reason of the disaster or the influx of military personnel, except that the increase may not exceed the amount equal to 20 percent of the rate of basic allowance for housing otherwise prescribed for the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A member may be paid a basic allowance for housing at a rate increased under this paragraph only if the member certifies to the Secretary concerned that the member has incurred increased housing costs in the area by reason of the disaster or the influx of military personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subject to subparagraph (E), an increase in the rates of basic allowance for housing in an area under this paragraph shall remain in effect until the effective date of the first adjustment in rates of basic allowance for housing made for the area pursuant to a redetermination of housing costs in the area under this subsection that occurs after the date of the increase under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) An increase in the rates of basic allowance for housing for an area may not be prescribed under this paragraph or continue after December 31, 2019.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing Outside the United States</cap-smallcap>.—(1) The Secretary of Defense may prescribe an overseas basic allowance for housing for a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside of the United States. The Secretary shall establish the basic allowance for housing under this subsection on the basis of housing costs in the overseas area in which the member is assigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing in an overseas area and the actual monthly cost of housing for the member is not reduced, the monthly amount of the allowance in an area outside the United States may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member. The monthly amount of the allowance may be adjusted to reflect changes in currency rates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the rate of the basic allowance for quarters (with dependents) for the member's pay grade, as such rate was in effect on December 31, 1997, under this section (as in effect on that date); and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Payment Authorized</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary concerned may pay a cost-of-living allowance to the eligible members of a uniformed service under the jurisdiction of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Eligible Members</cap-smallcap>.—The following members are eligible to receive a cost-of-living allowance under this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A member assigned to a high cost area in the continental United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A member assigned to an unaccompanied tour of duty outside the continental United States if the primary dependent of the member resides in a high cost area in the continental United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A member assigned to duty in the continental United States if the Secretary of the uniformed service concerned determines that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the primary dependent of the member must reside in a high cost area in the continental United States by reason of the member's duty location or other circumstances; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it would be inequitable for the member's eligibility for the allowance to be determined on the basis of the duty location of the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>High Cost Area Defined</cap-smallcap>.—An area is a high cost area for a fiscal year for purposes of this section if the uniformed services cost of living for that area for the base period exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United States for such base period by at least the threshold percentage. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall establish the threshold percentage, except that the threshold percentage may not be less than 8 percent. The administering Secretaries shall prescribe a higher threshold percentage to be applied for a fiscal year when it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the total amount of the payments of the cost-of-living allowance made to members of the uniformed services under this section for such fiscal year does not exceed the total amount available to all uniformed services for that fiscal year for paying such allowance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Amount of Allowance</cap-smallcap>.—The cost-of-living allowance that may be paid to a member for a high cost area for a fiscal year shall be the amount that is equal to the product of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of the average spendable income determined applicable for the regular military compensation level of such member under subsection (g); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the percentage equal to the excess of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage by which the uniformed services cost of living for the member's high cost area for the base period exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United States for such base period, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the threshold percentage applicable to such fiscal year under subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitation to One Allowance</cap-smallcap>.—If primary dependents of a member reside separately in different high cost areas—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member may be paid only one cost-of-living allowance under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the cost-of-living allowance payable to the member shall be the highest of the amounts computed under this section for such high cost areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Service Not Covered</cap-smallcap>.—(1) A cost-of-living allowance may not be paid a member under this section for the days authorized for travel of the member in connection with a permanent change of duty station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a reserve component is not eligible for a cost-of-living allowance under this section unless the member is on active duty under a call or order to active duty that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specifies a period of 140 days or more; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) states that the call or order to active duty is in support of a contingency operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Average Spendable Income</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary of Defense shall determine, using a methodology and assumptions that the Secretary considers appropriate, the amounts of average spendable income of members of the uniformed services for various ranges of regular military compensation. For purposes of this subsection, spendable income is the total amount of regular military compensation that is available for purchase of goods and services after allocation of amounts for taxes, insurance, housing, gifts and contributions, and savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Joint Regulations</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary of Defense and the other administering Secretaries shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Other Definitions</cap-smallcap>.—In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term "primary dependent", with respect to a member, means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the member's spouse; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an unmarried member, a dependent described in paragraph (2) or (4) of section 401(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term "cost of living" means a price index selected by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, from among the following indices:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Consumer Price Index (all items–United States city average) published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Any other index developed in the private sector that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, determines is comparable to the Consumer Price Index and is appropriate for use for purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term "uniformed services cost of living" means the price index selected as described in paragraph (2) and adjusted as the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, considers appropriate to reflect variations between expenses of members of the uniformed services (as offset by the basic allowance for subsistence) and the corresponding expenses of persons not members of the uniformed services with regard to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Nonhousing costs (including costs of transportation, goods, and services, taking into consideration savings attributable to use of such military facilities as commissary stores and exchange stores).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Average income tax paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Cost of health care.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term "base period", with respect to a fiscal year, means the 12-month period ending on June 30 of the year in which such fiscal year begins.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term "administering Secretaries" means the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary of Defense, with respect to the armed forces (other than the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Secretary of Homeland Security, with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words "Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section," are inserted for clarity. The words "of an armed force" are inserted, since the source section, as originally enacted, did not apply to the Public Health Service or the Coast and Geodetic Survey. (See section 243 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 492).) The words "of the Army, or the Air Force, without specification of component" are inserted to reflect the definition of "reserve component" in section 102(k) of the source statute. That definition is executed throughout this revised title. For that reason, the words "but not as a member of the Army without specification of component or the Air Force without specification of component, in section 255(a)(2) of existing title 37", are omitted, and since those categories are excluded by the words "member of a reserve component". The words "of a reserve component", in section 255(a)(3) of existing title 37, are omitted, since the Ready Reserve cannot be in anything other than a reserve component.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words "heretofore or hereafter" are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words "An officer" are substituted for the words "any individual", since the revised section applies only to officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words "who is in pay grade O–1, O–2, or O–3" are substituted for the words "is receiving the pay of the junior assistant, assistant, or senior assistant grade" to reflect current terminology. (See chapter 3 of this revised title.) The last sentence is substituted for section 214 (words following semicolon) of title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words "as a temporary officer" are inserted for clarity. The words "5596 or" are substituted for section 302(f) of the Act of August 7, 1947, cited above.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Entitlement to Allowance</cap-smallcap>.—(1) In addition to any allowance or per diem to which he otherwise may be entitled under this title a member of a uniformed service with dependents is entitled to a monthly allowance equal to $250 if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the movement of his dependents to his permanent station or a place near that station is not authorized at the expense of the United States under section 476 of this title and his dependents do not reside at or near that station;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) he is on temporary duty away from his permanent station for a continuous period of more than 30 days and his dependents do not reside at or near his temporary duty station.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member who becomes entitled to an allowance under this subsection by virtue of duty prescribed in subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (1) for a continuous period of more than 30 days is entitled to the allowance effective as of the earlier of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the first day of that period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day the member ceased being entitled to a previous allowance under this subsection by reason of the end of duty prescribed in such subparagraphs, if the member ceased being entitled to the previous allowance within 30 days before the first day of that period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Entitlement When No Residence or Household Maintained for Dependents</cap-smallcap>.—An allowance is payable under subsection (a) even though the member does not maintain for his primary dependents who would otherwise normally reside with him, a residence or household, subject to his management and control, which he is likely to share with them as a common household when his duty assignment permits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Election to Serve Unaccompanied Tour of Duty</cap-smallcap>.—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), a member who elects to serve a tour of duty unaccompanied by his dependents at a permanent station to which the movement of his dependents is authorized at the expense of the United States under section 476 of this title is not entitled to an allowance under subsection (a)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The prohibition in the first sentence of paragraph (1) does not apply to a member who elects to serve an unaccompanied tour of duty because a dependent cannot accompany the member to or at that permanent station for certified medical reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary concerned may waive paragraph (1) in situations in which it would be inequitable to deny the allowance to the member because of unusual family or operational circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Entitlement While Spouse Entitled to Basic Pay</cap-smallcap>.—(1) A member married to another member of the uniformed services becomes entitled, regardless of any other dependency status, to an allowance under subsection (a) by virtue of duty prescribed in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of such subsection if the members were residing together immediately before being separated by reasons of execution of military orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a married couple, both of whom are members of the uniformed services, with dependents are simultaneously assigned to duties described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (a)(1) and the members resided together with their dependents immediately before their assignments, the Secretary concerned shall pay each of the members the full amount of the monthly allowance specified in such subsection until one of the members is no longer assigned to duties described in such subparagraphs. Upon expiration of the additional allowance, paragraph (1) shall continue to apply to the remaining member so long as the member is assigned to duties described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of such subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Section 421 of this title does not apply to bar the entitlement to an allowance under this section. Except as provided in paragraph (2), not more than one monthly allowance may be paid with respect to a married couple under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) In connection with the change of temporary or permanent station of a member in a pay grade below pay grade O–6, the Secretary concerned may authorize a higher weight allowance than the weight allowance determined under subparagraph (C) for the member if the Secretary concerned determines that the application of the weight allowance determined under such subparagraph would result in significant hardship to the member or the dependents of the member. An increase in weight allowance under this clause may not result in a weight allowance exceeding the weight allowance specified in subparagraph (C) for pay grades O–6 to O–10, unless the additional weight allowance in excess of such maximum is intended to permit the shipping of consumables that cannot be reasonably obtained at the new station of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In addition to the weight allowance authorized for such member with dependents under paragraph (C), the Secretary concerned may authorize up to an additional 500 pounds in weight allowance for shipment of professional books and equipment belonging to the spouse of such member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Homeland Security for the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy, and midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy shall be entitled, in connection with temporary or permanent station change, to transportation of baggage and household effects as provided in subparagraph (A). The weight allowance for cadets and midshipmen is 350 pounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) A member entitled to transportation of baggage and household effects under subparagraph (A) may, as an alternative to the provision of transportation, be paid reimbursement or, at the member's request, a monetary allowance in advance for the cost of transportation of the baggage and household effects. The monetary allowance may be paid only if the amount of the allowance does not exceed the cost that would be incurred by the Government under subparagraph (A) for the transportation of the baggage and household effects. Appropriations available to the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services for providing transportation of baggage or household effects of members of the uniformed services shall be available to pay a reimbursement or monetary allowance under this subparagraph. The Secretary concerned may prescribe the manner in which the risk of liability for damage, destruction, or loss of baggage or household effects arranged, packed, crated, or loaded by a member is allocated among the member, the United States, and any contractor when a reimbursement or monetary allowance is elected under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned may pay a member a share (determined pursuant to such regulations) of the savings resulting to the United States when the total weights of the member's baggage and household effects shipped and stored under subparagraph (A) are less than the average weights of the baggage and household effects that are shipped and stored, respectively, by other members in the same grade and with the same dependents status as the member in connection with changes of station that are comparable to the member's change of station. The total savings shall be equal to the difference between the cost of shipping and cost of storing such average weights of baggage and household effects, respectively, and the corresponding costs associated with the weights of the member's baggage and household effects. For the administration of this subparagraph, the Secretary of Defense shall annually determine the average weights of baggage and household effects shipped and stored in connection with a change of temporary or permanent station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subject to clause (iii), in connection with an evacuation from a permanent station located in a foreign area, a member is entitled to transportation (including shipment and payment of any quarantine costs) of family household pets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A member entitled to transportation under clause (i) may be paid reimbursement or, at the member's request, a monetary allowance in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (F) if the member secures by commercial means shipment and any quarantining of the pets otherwise subject to transportation under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The provision of transportation under clause (i) and the payment of reimbursement under clause (ii) shall be subject to such regulations as the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe with respect to members of the armed forces for purposes of this subparagraph. Such regulations may specify limitations on the types, size, and number of pets for which transportation may be provided or reimbursement paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The transportation and allowances authorized under paragraph (1) may be paid or provided to a member upon his separation from the service or release from active duty only if the member applies for the transportation and allowances not later than 180 days after the date of his separation or release from active duty. If a member to whom this paragraph applies has been authorized nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the 180-day period shall not begin until such authorization for nontemporary storage expires. This paragraph does not apply to a member to whom subsection (g)(1) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The allowances and transportation authorized by subsections (a) and (b) are in addition to those authorized by sections 403(c), 474, and 475 of this title and are—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subject to such conditions and limitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for such grades, ranks, and ratings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to and from such places;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">prescribed by the Secretaries concerned. Transportation of the household effects of a member may not be made by commercial air carrier at an estimated over-all cost that is more than the estimated over-all cost of the transportation thereof by other means, unless an appropriate transportation officer has certified in writing to his commanding officer that those household effects to be so transported are necessary for use in carrying out assigned duties, or are necessary to prevent undue hardship and other means of transportation will not fill those needs. However, not more than 1,000 pounds of unaccompanied baggage may be transported by commercial air carrier, without regard to the preceding sentence, under regulations prescribed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may be authorized in facilities of the United States, or in commercial facilities when it is considered to be more economical to the United States. However, the weight of baggage and household effects stored, plus the weight of the baggage and household effects transported, in connection with a change of station may not be more than the maximum weight limitations in regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned when it is not otherwise fixed by law. In the event a member's baggage and household effects exceed such maximum weight limitation, the Secretary concerned, if requested to do so by the member, may pay the costs for the nontemporary storage of that excess weight and collect the amount paid from the member's pay and allowances, or collect the amount in such other manner as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate. The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may not be authorized for a period longer than one year from the date the member concerned is separated from the service, retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, discharged, or released from active duty, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned for a member who, on that date, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment; or in the case of a member who—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except in the case of a member who, on the date of his separation, discharge, or release, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment, the cost of the storage, for the period that exceeds one year, shall be paid by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of his dependents, baggage, and household effects, the Secretaries concerned may authorize the movement of the dependents, baggage, and household effects and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof (as the case may be), plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b). This subsection may be used only under unusual or emergency circumstances, including those in which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member is performing duty at a place designated by the Secretary concerned as being within a zone from which dependents should be evacuated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) orders which direct the member's travel in connection with temporary duty do not provide for return to the permanent station or do not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from his permanent station; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the member is serving on permanent duty at a station outside the United States, in Hawaii or Alaska, or on sea duty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, transportation for dependents, baggage, and household effects of a member, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, is authorized if the member dies while entitled to basic pay under chapter 3 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned shall give the dependents of a member described in paragraph (1) a period of not less than three years, beginning on the date of the death of the member, during which to select a home for the purposes of the travel and transportation allowances authorized by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member who—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is involuntarily separated from active duty during the period beginning on October 1, 1990, and ending on December 31, 2001,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

In addition, baggage and household effects may be shipped to a location other than the home selected by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If baggage and household effects of a member are shipped to a place selected by a member as his home under section 474(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 474(c)(2) of this title or to a location other than the home selected by the member, or if transportation is provided for a member's dependents to a place selected by the member as his home under section 474(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 474(c)(2) of this title, and the costs of that shipment or transportation are in excess of those that would have been incurred if the shipment had been made or the transportation had been provided to a location in the United States (other than Alaska or Hawaii), the member shall pay that excess cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a member authorized to select a home under section 474(c) of this title accrues that right or any entitlement under this subsection but dies before the member exercises the right or entitlement, that right or entitlement accrues to and may be exercised by the surviving dependents at any time before the end of the three-year period beginning on the date on which the member accrued that right or entitlement. If there are no surviving dependents, the baggage and household effects of the deceased member may be shipped to the home of the person legally entitled to such baggage and effects. However, if baggage and household effects are shipped under circumstances described in paragraph (2) in which the member would have been required to pay the excess costs of that shipment, the surviving dependents or the person legally entitled to the baggage and household effects, as the case may be, shall pay that excess cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) If the Secretary concerned determines that it is in the best interests of a member described in paragraph (2) or the member's dependents and the United States, the Secretary may, when orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects—</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member referred to in paragraph (1) is a member who—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is serving at a station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) receives an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions; or</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, "household and personal effects" and "household effects" may include, in addition to other authorized weight allowances, two privately owned motor vehicles which may be shipped at United States expense. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, and in place of the transportation of household and personal effects, a dependent, who would otherwise be entitled to transportation of household and personal effects under this section, may transport a house trailer or mobile dwelling within and between the areas specified in section 479 of this title for use as a residence by one of the following means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) transport it and be reimbursed by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) deliver it to an agent of the United States for transportation by the United States or by commercial means; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have it transported by commercial means, and be reimbursed by the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If a trailer or dwelling is transported under clause (2) or (3), that transportation may include two privately owned motor vehicles which may be shipped at United States expense. Transportation, and incidental costs, authorized by this section shall be at United States expense without any cost limitation, and any payment authorized may be made in advance of the transportation concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking of household and personal effects) may be provided for the dependents and household and personal effects of a member of a uniformed service on active duty (without regard to pay grade) who is officially reported as dead, injured, ill, or absent for a period of more than 29 days in a missing status—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the member's official residence of record;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the residence of his dependent, next of kin, or other person entitled to custody of the effects, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) on request of the member (if injured or ill), or his dependent, next of kin, or other person described in clause (2), to another location determined in advance or later approved by the Secretary concerned, or his designee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">When he considers it necessary, the Secretary concerned may, with respect to the household and personal effects of a member who is officially reported as absent for a period of more than 29 days in a missing status, authorize the nontemporary storage of those effects for a period of one year, or longer when justified. In addition, he may authorize additional movements of, and prescribe transportation for, the dependents and household and personal effects, or the dependents and house trailer or mobile dwelling, of a member who is officially reported as absent for a period of more than one year in a missing status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a member described in subsection (b) is in an injured or ill status, transportation of dependents and household and personal effects authorized by this section may be provided only when prolonged hospitalization or treatment is anticipated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Transportation requested by a dependent may be authorized under this section only if there is a reasonable relationship between the circumstances of the dependent and the requested destination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In place of the transportation for dependents authorized by this section, and after the travel is completed, the Secretary concerned may authorize—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reimbursement for the commercial cost of the transportation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a monetary allowance at the prescribed rate for all, or that part, of the travel for which transportation in kind is not furnished.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary concerned may store the household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b) until proper disposition can be made. The cost of the storage and transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking) of household and personal effects shall be charged against appropriations currently available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary concerned may, when he determines that there is an emergency and a sale would be in the best interests of the United States, provide for the public or private sale of motor vehicles and other bulky items of household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b). Before a sale, and if practicable, a reasonable effort shall be made to determine the desires of the interested persons. The net proceeds received from the sale shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, be sent to the owner or other persons. If there are no such persons, or if they or their addresses are not known within one year from the date of sale, the net proceeds may be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Claims for net proceeds that are covered into the Treasury under subsection (g) may be filed with the Secretary of Defense by the rightful owners, their heirs or next of kin, or their legal representatives at any time before the end of a 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury. When a claim is filed, the Secretary of Defense shall allow or disallow it. A claim that is allowed shall be paid from the appropriation for refunding money erroneously received and covered. If a claim is not filed before the end of the 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury, it is barred from being acted on by the courts or the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under this section does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the dependent for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use. The amount reimbursed may not exceed $30 per day, and the rental period for which reimbursement may be provided expires after 7 days or on the date on which the delayed vehicle arrives at the authorized destination (whichever occurs first). In a case in which two motor vehicles of a member (or the dependent or dependents of a member) are transported at the expense of the United States, no reimbursement is payable under this subsection unless both motor vehicles do not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicles by the designated delivery date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) This section does not amend or repeal—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 2575, 2733, 4712, 6522, or 9712 of title 10;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, the term "discharge" means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of an enlisted member, separation or release from active duty under honorable conditions, termination of an enlistment in conjunction with the commencement of a successive enlistment (without regard to the date of the expiration of the term of the enlistment being terminated), or appointment as an officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an officer, separation or release from active duty under honorable conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of either an officer or an enlisted member, death while on active duty unless the decedent was put to death as lawful punishment for a crime or a military offense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of an officer or an enlisted member of a reserve component who is not serving on active duty, separation or release from the reserve component under honorable conditions, or death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in the case of an enlisted member of a reserve component who is not serving on active duty, termination of enlistment in conjunction with the commencement of a successive enlistment, or appointment as an officer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) A member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who has accrued leave to his credit at the time of his discharge, is entitled to be paid in cash or by a check on the Treasurer of the United States for such leave on the basis of the basic pay to which he was entitled on the date of discharge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payment may not be made under this subsection to a member who is discharged for the purpose of accepting an appointment or a warrant in any uniformed service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Payment may not be made to a member for any leave he elects to have carried over to a new enlistment in any uniformed service on the day after the date of his discharge; but payment may be made to a member for any leave he elects not to carry over to a new enlistment. However, the number of days of leave for which payment is made may not exceed sixty, less the number of days for which payment was previously made under this section after February 9, 1976.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A member to whom a payment may not be made under this subsection, or a member who reverts from officer to enlisted status, carries the accrued leave standing to his credit from the one status to the other within any uniformed service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The limitation in the second sentence of paragraph (3) and in subsection (f) shall not apply with respect to leave accrued—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by a member of a reserve component while serving on active duty in support of a contingency operation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by a member of the armed forces in the Retired Reserve while serving on active duty in support of a contingency operation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) by a retired member of the Regular Army, Regular Navy, Regular Air Force, or Regular Marine Corps or a member of the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve while the member is serving on active duty in support of a contingency operation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) by a member of a reserve component while serving on active duty, full-time National Guard duty, or active duty for training for a period of more than 30 days but not in excess of 365 days.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) An enlisted member of the armed forces who would lose accumulated leave in excess of 120 days of leave under section 701(f)(1) of title 10 may elect to be paid in cash or by a check on the Treasurer of the United States for any leave in excess so accumulated for up to 30 days of such leave. A member may make an election under this paragraph only once.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Unused accrued leave for which payment is made under subsection (b) is not considered as service for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Payments for unused accrued leave under subsections (b) and (g), in the case of a member who dies while on active duty or in the case of a member or former member who dies after retirement or discharge and before he receives that payment, shall be made in accordance with section 2771 of title 10. In the case of a member who dies while on active duty, payment for unused accrued leave under subsections (b) and (g) shall be based upon the unused accrued leave the member carried forward into the leave year during which he died plus the unused leave that accrued to him during that leave year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The limitations in the second sentence of subsection (b)(3), subsection (f), and the second sentence of subsection (g) shall not apply with respect to a payment made under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) A member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is discharged under other than honorable conditions forfeits all accrued leave to his credit at the time of his discharge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may require that a member of a uniformed service who is discharged before completing six months of active duty because of a failure to serve satisfactorily (as determined by the Secretary concerned) forfeit all accrued leave to his credit at the time of his discharge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The number of days upon which payment under subsection (b) or (g) is based may not exceed sixty, less the number of days for which payment has been previously made under such subsections after February 9, 1976. For the purposes of this subsection, the number of days upon which payment may be based shall be determined without regard to any break in service or change in status in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) An officer of the Regular Corps of the Public Health Service, or an officer of the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service on active duty, who is credited with accumulated and accrued annual leave on the date of his separation, retirement, or release from active duty, shall, if his application for that leave is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, be paid for that leave in a lump-sum on the basis of his basic pay, subsistence allowance, and allowance for quarters whether or not he is receiving that allowance on that date. However, the number of days upon which the lump-sum payment is based is subject to subsection (f). A lump-sum payment may not be made under this subsection to an officer—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whose appointment expires or is terminated and who, without a break in active service, accepts a new appointment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) who is retired for age in time of war and is continued on, or recalled to, active duty without a break in active service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) who is transferred to another department or agency of the United States under circumstances in which, by any other law, his leave may be transferred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In this subsection, the term "accumulated annual leave" means unused accrued annual leave carried forward from one leave year into the next leave year, and the term "accrued annual leave" means the annual leave accruing to an officer during one leave year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Payment shall be made for all leave accumulated under section 701(g) of title 10 as soon as possible after the name of the person concerned is removed from a missing status, as defined in section 551(2) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraphs (1), (5), (6), and (7) only apply with respect to a case to which section 555 of this title applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the Secretary concerned, in a case to which section 555 of this title applies, receives information that he considers establishes conclusively the death of a member of a uniformed service, he shall, notwithstanding any earlier action relating to death or other status of the member, act on it as an official report of death. After the end of the 12-month period in a missing status prescribed by section 555 of this title, the Secretary concerned, or his designee, shall, when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that a member in a missing status is dead, make a finding of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may determine the entitlement of a member to pay and allowances under this chapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive. An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that a member captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may, when warranted by the circumstances, reconsider a determination made under this chapter, and change or modify it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the account of a member has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this chapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the member if the Secretary concerned, or his designee, determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the member was not a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from pay and allowances of a member for the period he is entitled to pay and allowances under section 552 of this title may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when it was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death.

Any determination made by the Secretary concerned, or his designee, under this section in a case to which section 555 of this title applies is conclusive on all other departments and agencies of the United States.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term "captive status" means a missing status of a member of the uniformed services which, as determined by the President, arises because of a hostile action and is a result of membership in the uniformed services, but does not include a period of captivity of a member as a prisoner of war if Congress provides to such member, in an Act enacted after August 27, 1986, monetary payment in respect of such period of captivity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term "former captive" means a person who, as a member of the uniformed services, was held in a captive status.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish a savings fund to which the Secretary concerned may allot all or any portion of the pay and allowances of any member of the uniformed services who is in a captive status to the extent that such pay and allowances are not subject to an allotment under section 553 of this title or any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts so allotted shall bear interest at a rate which, for any calendar quarter, shall be equal to the average rate paid on United States Treasury bills with three-month maturities issued during the preceding calendar quarter. Such interest shall be computed quarterly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amounts in the savings fund credited to a member shall be considered as pay and allowances for purposes of section 553(c) of this title and shall otherwise be subject to withdrawal under procedures which the Secretary of the Treasury shall establish.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any interest accruing under this subsection on—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any amount for which a member is indebted to the United States under section 552(c) of this title shall be deemed to be part of the amount due under such section; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An allotment under this subsection may be made without regard to section 553(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the President shall make a cash payment to any person who is a former captive. Such payment shall be made before the end of the one-year period beginning on the date on which the captive status of such person terminates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in section 802 of the Victims of Terrorism Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 5569 note), the amount of such payment shall be determined by the President under the provisions of section 5569(d)(2) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The President—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) may defer such payment in the case of any former captive who during such one-year period is charged with an offense described in clause (ii), until final disposition of such charge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) may deny such payment in the case of any former captive who is convicted of a captivity-related offense—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) referred to in subsection (b) or (c) of section 8312 of title 5; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) under chapter 47 of title 10 (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) that is punishable by dishonorable discharge, dismissal, or confinement for one year or more.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), a captivity-related offense is an offense that is—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) committed by a person while the person is in a captive status; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) related to the captive status of the person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A payment under this subsection is in addition to any other amount provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any amount due a person under this subsection shall, after the death of such person, be deemed to be pay and allowances for the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any payment made under paragraph (1) that is later denied under paragraph (3)(A)(ii) is a claim of the United States Government for purposes of section 3711 of title 31.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service may be paid in advance—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not more than three months&apos; pay of such member upon such member's change of permanent station; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of an allotment made from such member's pay to a dependent if such member is assigned or scheduled for assignment to sea duty or other duty with a unit or command deployed or to be deployed outside the United States and the allotment is made by such member not more than sixty days before the scheduled date of the assignment of such member to such duty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service who is on duty at a distant station where the pay and emoluments to which he is entitled cannot be disbursed regularly, may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an advance of pay to a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside the United States, or other place designated by the Secretary of Defense, of not more than two months&apos; basic pay may be made to a member if the member or the dependents of the member are ordered evacuated by competent authority. An advance of pay under this subsection is not subject to the conditions under which advances of pay may be made under subsection (a) or (b). An advance may be made on the basis of the evacuation of a member's dependents only if all dependents of members of the uniformed services are ordered evacuated from the place where the member's dependents are located. In the case of a member with dependents, the payment may be made directly to dependents previously designated by the member. The Secretary concerned or his designee may waive any right of recovery of not more than one month's basic pay advanced under this subsection if he finds that recovery of the advance would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If a person to whom an advance of pay is made under subsection (a), (b), or (c) dies or is separated from his uniformed service, before liquidation of that advance, the amount remaining unliquidated at the time of his death or separation shall be credited to the account of the disbursing officer concerned. However, the unliquidated amount remains a debt of that person or his estate to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) As far as practicable, regulations for the administration of subsections (a)–(d) shall be uniform for all of the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an obligation for an advance of pay made pursuant to this section shall be recorded as an obligation only in the fiscal year in which the entitlement of the member to the pay accrues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Current appropriations available for advance payments under this section may be transferred to the prior fiscal year appropriation available for the same purpose in the amount of any unliquidated advance payments that remain at the end of such prior fiscal year. Such unliquidated advance payments shall then be credited to the current appropriation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, an advance of pay of not more than three months&apos; pay may be made to an officer of the Coast Guard who is ordered to sea duty or to or from shore duty beyond the seas. In addition, the Commandant of the Coast Guard may direct such advances as he considers necessary and proper to members of the Coast Guard stationed at distant stations where the pay and emoluments to which they are entitled cannot be paid regularly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the dislocation allowance authorized by section 477 of this title for a member of a uniformed service whose dependents are covered by section 475a(a) of this title may be paid in advance of the evacuation of the dependents and to the dependents designated by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of section 3324 of title 31, the Secretary concerned may, when the last day of the pay period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, authorize the payment of pay and allowances to members of uniformed service under his jurisdiction on the preceding workday but not more than three days before the last day of that pay period. If a member dies after he has received an advance payment under this subsection, but before the last day of the pay period for which the payment is made, no part of the amount so advance is recoverable by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program upon reporting for a period of active duty required by section 2121(c) of title 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Senior Reserve Officers&apos; Training Corps who is ordered to field training or a practice required under section 2109 of title 10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subject to subsection (c), an amount due the United States from an enlisted member of the Army or the Air Force may be deducted from his pay on final statement, or from his savings on his clothing allowance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The amount of any damage, or cost of repairs, to arms or equipment caused by the abuse or negligence of a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, as the case may be, who had the care of, or was using, the property when it was damaged, shall be deducted from his pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) If, upon final settlement of the accounts of an officer of the Army or the Air Force charged with the issue of an article of military supply, there is a deficiency of that article, or if an article of military supply with whose issue an officer is charged is damaged, the value of the lost article or the amount of the damage shall be charged against the officer and deducted from his monthly pay, unless he shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force, as the case may be, by one or more affidavits setting forth the circumstances, that he was not at fault.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this subsection, the term "service relief society" means the Army Emergency Relief, the Air Force Aid Society, the Navy Relief Society, or the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), but subject to subsection (d), the percentage of the adjustment taking effect under this section during each of fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006, shall be one-half of one percentage point higher than the percentage that would otherwise be applicable under such paragraph.</p>
