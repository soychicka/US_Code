The words “applicable to anyone” are substituted for “to the several collectors, receivers, depositaries, officers, and others” for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words. In subclause (A), the words “for the Government” are inserted because section 8 of the Act of June 30, 1864 (ch. 172, 13 Stat. 221), from which section 251 of the Revised Statutes is derived, used the phrase “in behalf of the United States”. In subclause (B), the words “those notes and securities” are substituted for “the same” for clarity.</p>

July 31, 1950, 64 Stat. 1281) that continues to have legal effect is section 2 that is restated in clause (2).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(4), before subclause (A), the word “detail” is substituted for “to use for, and in connection with” to eliminate unnecessary words. The words “in addition to details authorized under another law” are substituted for 31:1017(last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words and because subsequent laws would also provide additional authority to detail. The words “and the several branches of the public service under its control” are omitted as being included in “Department”.

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">We in government often are quick to call for reform in other institutions, but slow to reform ourselves. Yet nowhere today is modern management more needed than in government itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed and the Congress accepted a reorganization plan that laid the groundwork for providing managerial assistance for a modern Presidency.</p>
<p class="note-body">The plan placed the Bureau of the Budget within the Executive Office of the President. It made available to the President direct access to important new management instruments. The purpose of the plan was to improve the administration of the Government—to ensure that the Government could perform “promptly, effectively, without waste or lost motion.”</p>
<p class="note-body">Fulfilling that purpose today is far more difficult—and more important—than it was 30 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body">Last April, I created a President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization and named to it a distinguished group of outstanding experts headed by Roy L. Ash. I gave the Council a broad charter to examine ways in which the Executive Branch could be better organized. I asked it to recommend specific organizational changes that would make the Executive Branch a more vigorous and more effective instrument for creating and carrying out the programs that are needed today. The Council quickly concluded that the place to begin was in the Executive Office of the President itself. I agree.</p>
<p class="note-body">The past 30 years have seen enormous changes in the size, structure and functions of the Federal Government. The budget has grown from less than $10 billion to $200 billion. The number of civilian employees has risen from one million to more than two and a half million. Four new Cabinet departments have been created, along with more than a score of independent agencies. Domestic policy issues have become increasingly complex. The interrelationships among Government programs have become more intricate. Yet the organization of the President's policy and management arms has not kept pace.</p>
<p class="note-body">Over three decades, the Executive Office of the President has mushroomed but not by conscious design. In many areas it does not provide the kind of staff assistance and support the President needs in order to deal with the problems of government in the 1970s. We confront the 1970s with a staff organization geared in large measure to the tasks of the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p class="note-body">One result, over the years, has been a tendency to enlarge the immediate White House staff—that is, the President's personal staff, as distinct from the institutional structure—to assist with management functions for which the President is responsible. This has blurred the distinction between personal staff and management institutions; it has left key management functions to be performed only intermittently and some not at all. It has perpetuated outdated structures.</p>
<p class="note-body">Another result has been, paradoxically, to inhibit the delegation of authority to Departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">A President whose programs are carefully coordinated, whose information system keeps him adequately informed, and whose organizational assignments are plainly set out, can delegate authority with security and confidence. A President whose office is deficient in these respects will be inclined, instead, to retain close control of operating responsibilities which he cannot and should not handle.</p>
<p class="note-body">Improving the management processes of the President's own office, therefore, is a key element in improving the management of the entire Executive Branch, and in strengthening the authority of its Departments and agencies. By providing the tools that are needed to reduce duplication, to monitor performance and to promote greater efficiency throughout the Executive Branch, this also will enable us to give the country not only more effective but also more economical government—which it deserves.</p>
<p class="note-body">To provide the management tools and policy mechanisms needed for the 1970s, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, prepared in accordance with Chapter 9 of Title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan draws not only on the work of the Ash Council itself, but also on the work of others that preceded—including the pioneering Brownlow Committee of 1936, the two Hoover Commissions, the Rockefeller Committee, and other Presidential task forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">Essentially, the plan recognizes that two closely connected but basically separate functions both center in the President's office: policy determination and executive management. This involves (1) what government should do, and (2) how it goes about doing it.</p>
<p class="note-body">My proposed reorganization creates a new entity to deal with each of these functions:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">—It establishes a Domestic Council, to coordinate policy formulation in the domestic area. This Cabinet group would be provided with an institutional staff, and to a considerable degree would be a domestic counterpart to the National Security Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">—It establishes an Office of Management and Budget, which would be the President's principal arm for the exercise of his managerial functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Domestic Council will be primarily concerned with what we do; the Office of Management and Budget will be primarily concerned with <em>how</em> we do it, and <em>how well</em> we do it.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">DOMESTIC COUNCIL</h4>
<p class="note-body">The past year's experience with the Council for Urban Affairs has shown how immensely valuable a Cabinet-level council can be as a forum for both discussion and action on policy matters that cut across departmental jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Domestic Council will be chaired by the President. Under the plan, its membership will include the Vice President, and the Secretaries of the Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health, Education and Welfare, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation, and the Attorney General. I also intend to designate as members the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and, while he remains a member of the Cabinet, the Postmaster General. (Although I continue to hope that the Congress will adopt my proposal to create, in place of the Post Office Department, a self-sufficient postal authority.) The President could add other Executive Branch officials at his discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Council will be supported by a staff under an Executive Director who will also be one of the President's assistants. Like the National Security Council staff, this staff will work in close coordination with the President's personal staff but will have its own institutional identity. By being established on a permanent, institutional basis, it will be designed to develop and employ the “institutional memory” so essential if continuity is to be maintained, and if experience is to play its proper role in the policy-making process.</p>
<p class="note-body">There does not now exist an organized, institutionally-staffed group charged with advising the President on the total range of domestic policy. The Domestic Council will fill that need. Under the President's direction, it will also be charged with integrating the various aspects of domestic policy into a consistent whole.</p>
<p class="note-body">Among the specific policy functions in which I intend the Domestic Council to take the lead are these:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">—Assessing national needs, collecting information and developing forecasts, for the purpose of defining national goals and objectives.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">—Identifying alternative ways of achieving these objectives, and recommending consistent, integrated sets of policy choices.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">—Providing rapid response to Presidential needs for policy advice on pressing domestic issues.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">—Coordinating the establishment of national priorities for the allocation of available resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">—Maintaining a continuous review of the conduct of ongoing programs from a policy standpoint, and proposing reforms as needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Much of the Council's work will be accomplished by temporary, ad hoc project committees. These might take a variety of forms, such as task forces, planning groups or advisory bodies. They can be established with varying degrees of formality, and can be set up to deal either with broad program areas or with specific problems. The committees will draw for staff support on Department and agency experts, supplemented by the Council's own staff and that of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">Establishment of the Domestic Council draws on the experience gained during the past year with the Council for Urban Affairs, the Cabinet Committee on the Environment and the Council for Rural Affairs. The principal key to the operation of these Councils has been the effective functioning of their various subcommittees. The Councils themselves will be consolidated into the Domestic Council; Urban, Rural and Environment subcommittees of the Domestic Council will be strengthened, using access to the Domestic Council staff.</p>
<p class="note-body">Overall, the Domestic Council will provide the President with a streamlined, consolidated domestic policy arm, adequately staffed, and highly flexible in its operation. It also will provide a structure through which departmental initiatives can be more fully considered, and expert advice from the Departments and agencies more fully utilized.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the reorganization plan, the technical and formal means by which the Office of Management and Budget is created is by re-designating the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget. The functions currently vested by law in the Bureau, or in its director, are transferred to the President, with the provision that he can then re-delegate them.</p>
<p class="note-body">As soon as the reorganization plan takes effect, I intend to delegate those statutory functions to the Director of the new Office of Management and Budget, including those under section 212 of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 [31 U.S.C. 1113].</p>
<p class="note-body">However, creation of the Office of Management and Budget represents far more than a mere change of name for the Bureau of the Budget. It represents a basic change in concept and emphasis, reflecting the broader management needs of the Office of the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office will still perform the key function of assisting the President in the preparation of the annual Federal budget and overseeing its execution. It will draw upon the skills and experience of the extraordinarily able and dedicated career staff developed by the Bureau of the Budget. But preparation of the budget as such will no longer be its dominant, overriding concern.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the budget function remains a vital tool of management, it will be strengthened by the greater emphasis the new office will place on fiscal analysis. The budget function is only one of several important management tools that the President must now have. He must also have a substantially enhanced institutional staff capability in other areas of executive management—particularly in program evaluation and coordination, improvement of Executive Branch organization, information and management systems, and development of executive talent. Under this plan, strengthened capability in these areas will be provided partly through internal reorganization, and it will also require additional staff resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office of Management and Budget will place much greater emphasis on the evaluation of program performance: on assessing the extent to which programs are actually achieving their intended results, and delivering the intended services to the intended recipients. This is needed on a continuing basis, not as a one-time effort. Program evaluation will remain a function of the individual agencies as it is today. However, a single agency cannot fairly be expected to judge overall effectiveness in programs that cross agency lines—and the difference between agency and Presidential perspectives requires a capacity in the Executive Office to evaluate program performance whenever appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office will expand efforts to improve interagency cooperation in the field. Washington-based coordinators will help work out interagency problems at the operating level, and assist in developing efficient coordinating mechanisms throughout the country. The success of these efforts depends on the experience, persuasion, and understanding of an Office which will be an expediter and catalyst. The Office will also respond to requests from State and local governments for assistance on intergovernmental programs. It will work closely with the Vice President and the Office of Intergovernmental Relations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Improvement of Government organization, information and management systems will be a major function of the Office of Management and Budget. It will maintain a continuous review of the organizational structures and management processes of the Executive Branch, and recommend needed changes. It will take the lead in developing new information systems to provide the President with the performance and other data that he needs but does not now get. When new programs are launched, it will seek to ensure that they are not simply forced into or grafted onto existing organizational structures that may not be appropriate. Resistance to organizational change is one of the chief obstacles to effective government; the new Office will seek to ensure that organization keeps abreast of program needs.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office will also take the lead in devising programs for the development of career executive talent throughout the Government. Not the least of the President's needs as Chief Executive is direct capability in the Executive Office for insuring that talented executives are used to the full extent of their abilities. Effective, coordinated efforts for executive manpower development have been hampered by the lack of a system for forecasting the needs for executive talent and appraising leadership potential. Both are crucial to the success of an enterprise—whether private or public.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Office of Management and Budget will be charged with advising the President on the development of new programs to recruit, train, motivate, deploy, and evaluate the men and women who make up the top ranks of the civil service, in the broadest sense of that term. It will not deal with individuals, but will rely on the talented professionals of the Civil Service Commission and the Departments and agencies themselves to administer these programs. Under the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget there will be joint efforts to see to it that all executive talent is well utilized wherever it may be needed throughout the Executive Branch, and to assure that executive training and motivation meet not only today's needs but those of the years ahead.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the new Office will continue the Legislative Reference functions now performed by the Bureau of the Budget, drawing together agency reactions on all proposed legislation, and helping develop legislation to carry out the President's program. It also will continue the Bureau's work of improving and coordinating Federal statistical services.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGES</h4>
<p class="note-body">The people deserve a more responsive and more effective Government. The times require it. These changes will help provide it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to Section 901(a)(1), “to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the Executive Branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;” and Section 901(a)(3), “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable.”</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganizations provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in Section 102(c) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the Executive Branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">While this plan will result in a modest increase in direct expenditures, its strengthening of the Executive Office of the President will bring significant indirect savings, and at the same time will help ensure that people actually receive the return they deserve for every dollar the Government spends. The savings will result from the improved efficiency these changes will provide throughout the Executive Branch—and also from curtailing the waste that results when programs simply fail to achieve their objectives. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate these indirect expenditure reductions which will result from the reorganization.</p>
<p class="note-body">I expect to follow with other reorganization plans, quite possibly including ones that will affect other activities of the Executive Office of the President. Our studies are continuing. But this by itself is a reorganization of major significance, and a key to the more effective functioning of the entire Executive Branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">These changes would provide an improved system of policy making and coordination, a strengthened capacity to perform those functions that are now the central concerns of the Bureau of the Budget, and a more effective set of management tools for the performance of other functions that have been rapidly increasing in importance.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization will not only improve the staff resources available to the President, but will also strengthen the advisory roles of those members of the Cabinet principally concerned with domestic affairs. By providing a means of formulating integrated and systematic recommendations on major domestic policy issues, the plan serves not only the needs of the President but also the interests of the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization plan is of major importance to the functioning of modern government. The national interest requires it. I urge that the Congress allow it to become effective.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12803, Apr. 30, 1992, 57 F.R. 19063, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure that the United States achieves the most beneficial economic use of its resources, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Definitions</em>. For purposes of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) “Privatization” means the disposition or transfer of an infrastructure asset, such as by sale or by long-term lease, from a State or local government to a private party.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) “Infrastructure asset” means any asset financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government and needed for the functioning of the economy. Examples of such assets include, but are not limited to: roads, tunnels, bridges, electricity supply facilities, mass transit, rail transportation, airports, ports, waterways, water supply facilities, recycling and wastewater treatment facilities, solid waste disposal facilities, housing, schools, prisons, and hospitals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) “Originally authorized purposes” means the general objectives of the original grant program; however, the term is not intended to include every condition required for a grantee to have obtained the original grant.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) “Transfer price” means: (i) the amount paid or to be paid by a private party for an infrastructure asset, if the asset is transferred as a result of competitive bidding; or (ii) the appraised value of an infrastructure asset, as determined by the head of the executive department or agency and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, if the asset is not transferred as a result of competitive bidding.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) “State and local governments” means the government of any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, and any county, municipality, city, town, township, local public authority, school district, special district, intrastate district, regional or interstate governmental entity, council of governments, and any agency or instrumentality of a local government, and any federally recognized Indian Tribe.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Fundamental Principles</em>. Executive departments and agencies shall be guided by the following objectives and principles: (a) Adequate and well-maintained infrastructure is critical to economic growth. Consistent with the principles of federalism enumerated in Executive Order No. 12612 [formerly set out under section 601 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees], and in order to allow the private sector to provide for infrastructure modernization and expansion, State and local governments should have greater freedom to privatize infrastructure assets.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Private enterprise and competitively driven improvements are the foundation of our Nation's economy and economic growth. Federal financing of infrastructure assets should not act as a barrier to the achievement of economic efficiencies through additional private market financing or competitive practices, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) State and local governments are in the best position to assess and respond to local needs. State and local governments should, subject to assuring continued compliance with Federal requirements that public use be on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, have maximum possible freedom to make decisions concerning the maintenance and disposition of their federally financed infrastructure assets.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) User fees are generally more efficient than general taxes as a means to support infrastructure assets. Privatization transactions should be structured so as not to result in unreasonable increases in charges to users.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Privatization Initiative</em>. To the extent permitted by law, the head of each executive department and agency shall undertake the following actions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Review those procedures affecting the management and disposition of federally financed infrastructure assets owned by State and local governments and modify those procedures to encourage appropriate privatization of such assets consistent with this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Assist State and local governments in their efforts to advance the objectives of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Approve State and local governments’ requests to privatize infrastructure assets, consistent with the criteria in section 4 of this order and, where necessary, grant exceptions to the disposition requirements of the “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments” common rule, or other relevant rules or regulations, for infrastructure assets; provided that the transfer price shall be distributed, as paid, in the following manner: (i) State and local governments shall first recoup in full the unadjusted dollar amount of their portion of total project costs (including any transaction and fix-up costs they incur) associated with the infrastructure asset involved; (ii) if proceeds remain, then the Federal Government shall recoup in full the amount of Federal grant awards associated with the infrastructure asset, less the applicable share of accumulated depreciation on such asset (calculated using the Internal Revenue Service accelerated depreciation schedule for the categories of assets in question); and (iii) finally, the State and local governments shall keep any remaining proceeds.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Criteria</em>. To the extent permitted by law, the head of an executive department or agency shall approve a request in accordance with section 3(c) of this order only if the grantee: (a) Agrees to use the proceeds described in section 3(c)(iii) of this order only for investment in additional infrastructure assets (after public notice of the proposed investment), or for debt or tax reduction; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Demonstrates that a market mechanism, legally enforceable agreement, or regulatory mechanism will ensure that: (i) the infrastructure asset or assets will continue to be used for their originally authorized purposes, as long as needed for those purposes, even if the purchaser becomes insolvent or is otherwise hindered from fulfilling the originally authorized purposes; and (ii) user charges will be consistent with any current Federal conditions that protect users and the public by limiting the charges.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Government-wide Coordination and Review</em>. In implementing Executive Order Nos. 12291 and 12498 [formerly set out under section 601 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees] and OMB Circular No. A–19, the Office of Management and Budget, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the provisions of those authorities, shall take action to ensure that the policies of the executive department and agencies are consistent with the principles, criteria, and requirements of this order. The Office of Management and Budget shall review the results of implementing this order and report thereon to the President 1 year after the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Preservation of Existing Authority</em>. Nothing in this order is in any way intended to limit any existing authority of the heads of executive departments and agencies to approve privatization proposals that are otherwise consistent with law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch, and is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12893. Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12893, Jan. 26, 1994, 59 F.R. 4233, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">A well-functioning infrastructure is vital to sustained economic growth, to the quality of life in our communities, and to the protection of our environment and natural resources. To develop and maintain its infrastructure facilities, our Nation relies heavily on investments by the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Our Nation will achieve the greatest benefits from its infrastructure facilities if it invests wisely and continually improves the quality and performance of its infrastructure programs. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Scope</em>. The principles and plans referred to in this order shall apply to Federal spending for infrastructure programs. For the purposes of this order, Federal spending for infrastructure programs shall include direct spending and grants for transportation, water resources, energy, and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Principles of Federal Infrastructure Investment.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Each executive department and agency with infrastructure responsibilities (hereinafter referred to collectively as “agencies”) shall develop and implement plans for infrastructure investment and management consistent with the following principles:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Systematic Analysis of Expected Benefits and Costs</em>. Infrastructure investments shall be based on systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs, including both quantitative and qualitative measures, in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) Benefits and costs should be quantified and monetized to the maximum extent practicable. All types of benefits and costs, both market and nonmarket, should be considered. To the extent that environmental and other nonmarket benefits and costs can be quantified, they shall be given the same weight as quantifiable market benefits and costs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Benefits and costs should be measured and appropriately discounted over the full life cycle of each project. Such analysis will enable informed tradeoffs among capital outlays, operating and maintenance costs, and nonmonetary costs borne by the public.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) When the amount and timing of important benefits and costs are uncertain, analyses shall recognize the uncertainty and address it through appropriate quantitative and qualitative assessments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) Analyses shall compare a comprehensive set of options that include, among other things, managing demand, repairing facilities, and expanding facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) Analyses should consider not only quantifiable measures of benefits and costs, but also qualitative measures reflecting values that are not readily quantified.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Efficient Management</em>. Infrastructure shall be managed efficiently in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) The efficient use of infrastructure depends not only on physical design features, but also on operational practices. To improve these practices, agencies should conduct periodic reviews of the operation and maintenance of existing facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Agencies should use these reviews to consider a variety of management practices that can improve the return from infrastructure investments. Examples include contracting practices that reward quality and innovation, and design standards that incorporate new technologies and construction techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) Agencies also should use these reviews to identify the demand for different levels of infrastructure services. Since efficient levels of service can often best be achieved by properly pricing infrastructure, the Federal Government—through its direct investments, grants, and regulations—should promote consideration of market-based mechanisms for managing infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Private Sector Participation</em>. Agencies shall seek private sector participation in infrastructure investment and management. Innovative public-private initiatives can bring about greater private sector participation in the ownership, financing, construction, and operation of the infrastructure programs referred to in section 1 of this order. Consistent with the public interest, agencies should work with State and local entities to minimize legal and regulatory barriers to private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure facilities and services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Encouragement of More Effective State and Local Programs</em>. To promote the efficient use of Federal infrastructure funds, agencies should encourage the State and local recipients of Federal grants to implement planning and information management systems that support the principles set forth in section 2(a) through (c) of this order. In turn, the Federal Government should use the information from the State and local recipients’ management systems to conduct the system-level reviews of the Federal Government's infrastructure programs that are required by this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Submission of Plans</em>. Agencies shall submit initial plans to implement these principles to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) by March 15, 1994. Agency plans shall list the actions that will be taken to provide the data and analysis necessary for supporting infrastructure-related proposals in future budget submissions. Agency implementation plans should be consistent with OMB Circular A–94 that outlines the analytical methods required under the principles set forth in section 2 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Application to Budget Submissions</em>. Beginning with the fiscal year 1996 budget submission to OMB, each agency should use these principles to justify major infrastructure investment and grant programs. Major programs are defined as those programs with annual budgetary resources in excess of $50 million.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Application to Legislative Proposals</em>. Beginning March 15, 1994, agencies shall employ the principles set forth in section 2 of this order and, at the request of OMB, shall provide supporting analyses when requesting OMB clearance for legislative proposals that would authorize or reauthorize infrastructure programs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Guidance</em>. The Office of Management and Budget shall provide guidance to the agencies on the implementation of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="note-body">In clause (1), “agency” (which is defined for purposes of this title in section 101 to mean a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States) is coextensive with and substituted for the term “department or establishment” which was defined in 31:2 as in part meaning “any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment of the Government, including any independent regulatory commission or board”. This definition merely restates and continues, and does not in any way change or expand, the definition in 31:2. Under that definition, entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority that have been interpreted to be outside the purview of the definition will continue to be outside the purview in the same manner and to the same extent that they were under 31:2. The words “includes the District of Columbia government” are used because of existing law but the inclusion of these words is not to be interpreted as construing the extent to which the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganizational Act (Pub. L. 93–198, 87 Stat. 774) supersedes the provisions codified in this title. The words “of the United States” are omitted as surplus. The text of 31:2 (2d–4th pars.) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The text of section 2 (3d par.) of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 (ch. 18, 42 Stat. 20), is omitted as obsolete because of section 501 of the revised title.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the section, a reference to 31:71 and 471 is omitted because the definitions in the section are not used in 31:71 and 471.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (1), “agency” (which is defined for purposes of this title in section 101 to mean a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States) is coextensive with and substituted for the term “department or establishment” which was defined in 31:2 as in part meaning “any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment of the Government, including any independent regulatory commission or board”. This definition merely restates and continues, and does not in any way change or expand, the definition in 31:2. Under that definition, entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority that have been interpreted to be outside the purview of the definition will continue to be outside the purview in the same manner and to the same extent that they were under 31:2. The words “includes the District of Columbia government” are used because of existing law but the inclusion of these words is not to be interpreted as construing the extent to which the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganizational Act (Pub. L. 93–198, 87 Stat. 774) supersedes the provisions codified in this title. The words “of the United States” are omitted as surplus. The text of 31:2(2d–4th pars.) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The text of section 2(3d par.) of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 (ch. 18, 42 Stat. 20), is omitted as obsolete because of section 501 of the revised title.</p>

The word “change” is substituted for “assemble, correlate, revise, reduce, or increase” in 31:16 (last sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words.

The words “submitted with the request contains obligations consistent with” are substituted for “furnished therewith consists of valid obligations as defined in” for clarity and because of the restatement. The words “The head of the agency shall support the report with a certification of the consistency” are substituted for “Each report made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be supported by certifications” in 31:200(c) for clarity.

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13457. Protecting American Taxpayers From Government Spending on Wasteful Earmarks</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13457, Jan. 29, 2008, 73 F.R. 6417, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. It is the policy of the Federal Government to be judicious in the expenditure of taxpayer dollars. To ensure the proper use of taxpayer funds that are appropriated for Government programs and purposes, it is necessary that the number and cost of earmarks be reduced, that their origin and purposes be transparent, and that they be included in the text of the bills voted upon by the Congress and presented to the President. For appropriations laws and other legislation enacted after the date of this order, executive agencies should not commit, obligate, or expend funds on the basis of earmarks included in any non-statutory source, including requests in reports of committees of the Congress or other congressional documents, or communications from or on behalf of Members of Congress, or any other non-statutory source, except when required by law or when an agency has itself determined a project, program, activity, grant, or other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Duties of Agency Heads</em>. (a) With respect to all appropriations laws and other legislation enacted after the date of this order, the head of each agency shall take all necessary steps to ensure that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) agency decisions to commit, obligate, or expend funds for any earmark are based on the text of laws, and in particular, are not based on language in any report of a committee of Congress, joint explanatory statement of a committee of conference of the Congress, statement of managers concerning a bill in the Congress, or any other non-statutory statement or indication of views of the Congress, or a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff thereof;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) agency decisions to commit, obligate, or expend funds for any earmark are based on authorized, transparent, statutory criteria and merit-based decision making, in the manner set forth in section II of OMB Memorandum M–07–10, dated February 15, 2007, to the extent consistent with applicable law; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) no oral or written communications concerning earmarks shall supersede statutory criteria, competitive awards, or merit-based decisionmaking.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) An agency shall not consider the views of a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff of the Congress with respect to commitments, obligations, or expenditures to carry out any earmark unless such views are in writing, to facilitate consideration in accordance with section 2(a)(ii) above. All written communications from the Congress, or a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff thereof, recommending that funds be committed, obligated, or expended on any earmark shall be made publicly available on the Internet by the receiving agency, not later than 30 days after receipt of such communication, unless otherwise specifically directed by the head of the agency, without delegation, after consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to preserve appropriate confidentiality between the executive and legislative branches.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Heads of agencies shall otherwise implement within their respective agencies the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, consistent with such instructions as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may prescribe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The head of each agency shall upon request provide to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget information about earmarks and compliance with this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Definitions</em>. For purposes of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term “agency” means an executive agency as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, and the United States Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission, but shall exclude the Government Accountability Office; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) the term “earmark” means funds provided by the Congress for projects, programs, or grants where the purported congressional direction (whether in statutory text, report language, or other communication) circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to the funds allocation process.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>General Provisions</em>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) authority granted by law to an agency or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the word “agency” is substituted for “department of the Government” because of section 101 of the revised title and for consistency with the other source provisions restated in the section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), before clause (1), the words “buy or lease” are substituted for “purchase or hire” for consistency. In clause (1)(C), the words “section 101 of title 5” are used because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Pub. L. 89–554, 80 Stat. 631).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), before clause (A), the word “agency” is substituted for “department” for consistency. The words “total cost” are substituted for “cost” because of the restatement. The words “(except costs required only for transportation)” are substituted for “which shall be in addition to the amount required for transportation” for clarity. Clause (A) is substituted for “completely equipped for operation” and 31:638a(c)(1)(2d sentence) to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2), the words “Notwithstanding any other provisions of law” are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words “armed forces” are substituted for “Military and Naval Establishments” for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e)(2), the words “motor boats, trucks” in 31:638d are omitted as being included in “vehicles”. The words “adopted by Congress” are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e)(3), the words “horse-drawn” in 31:638e are omitted because the section applies only to motor vehicles and aircraft described in 31:638a and also is obsolete. The words “motor boats” are omitted as being included in “vehicles”.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in this subchapter, an appropriation available for obligation for a definite period shall be apportioned to prevent obligation or expenditure at a rate that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation for the period. An appropriation for an indefinite period and authority to make obligations by contract before appropriations shall be apportioned to achieve the most effective and economical use. An apportionment may be reapportioned under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An appropriation subject to apportionment is apportioned by—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) months, calendar quarters, operating seasons, or other time periods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) activities, functions, projects, or objects; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a combination of the ways referred to in clauses (A) and (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The official designated in section 1513 of this title to make apportionments shall apportion an appropriation under paragraph (1) of this subsection as the official considers appropriate. Except as specified by the official, an amount apportioned is available for obligation under the terms of the appropriation on a cumulative basis unless reapportioned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) In apportioning or reapportioning an appropriation, a reserve may be established only—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to provide for contingencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to achieve savings made possible by or through changes in requirements or greater efficiency of operations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as specifically provided by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A reserve established under this subsection may be changed as necessary to carry out the scope and objectives of the appropriation concerned. When an official designated in section 1513 of this title to make apportionments decides that an amount reserved will not be required to carry out the objectives and scope of the appropriation concerned, the official shall recommend the rescission of the amount in the way provided in chapter 11 of this title for appropriation requests. Reserves established under this section shall be reported to Congress as provided in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 681 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An apportionment or a reapportionment shall be reviewed at least 4 times a year by the official designated in section 1513 of this title to make apportionments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of the Treasury may issue savings bonds and savings certificates of the United States Government and may buy, redeem, and make refunds under section 3111 of this title. Proceeds from the bonds and certificates shall be used for expenditures authorized by law. Savings bonds and certificates may be issued on an interest-bearing basis, on a discount basis, or on an interest-bearing and discount basis. Savings bonds shall mature not more than 20 years from the date of issue. Savings certificates shall mature not more than 10 years from the date of issue. The difference between the price paid and the amount received on redeeming a savings bond or certificate is interest under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) fix the investment yield for savings bonds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) change the investment yield on an outstanding savings bond, except that the yield on a bond for the period held may not be decreased below the minimum yield for the period guaranteed on the date of issue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may prescribe regulations providing that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) owners of savings bonds may keep the bonds after maturity or after a period beyond maturity during which the bonds have earned interest and continue to earn interest at rates consistent with paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) savings bonds earning a different rate of interest before the regulations are prescribed shall earn a rate of interest consistent with paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may prescribe for savings bonds and savings certificates issued under this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the form and amount of an issue and series;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the way in which they will be issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the conditions, including restrictions on transfer, to which they will be subject;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) conditions governing their redemption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) their sales price and denominations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a way to evidence payments for or on account of them and to provide for the exchange of savings certificates for savings bonds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the maximum amount issued in a year that may be held by one person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary may authorize financial institutions to make payments to redeem savings bonds and savings notes. A financial institution may be a paying agent only if the institution—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the usual course of business accepts, subject to withdrawal, money for deposit or the purchase of shares;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is under the supervision of a banking authority of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) has a regular office to do business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) is qualified under regulations prescribed by the Secretary in carrying out this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Secretary may prescribe a way in which a check issued to an individual (except a trust or estate) as a refund for taxes imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) may become a series E savings bond. However, a check may become a bond only if the claim for a refund is filed by the last day prescribed by law for filing the return (determined without any extensions) for the taxable year for which the refund is made. The Secretary may prescribe the time and way in which the check becomes a bond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A bond issued under this subsection is deemed to be a series E bond issued under this section, except that the bond shall bear an issue date of the first day of the first month beginning after the close of the taxable year for which the bond is issued. The Secretary also may provide that a bond issued to joint payees may be redeemed by either payee alone.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In issuing obligations under sections 3102–3104 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether an obligation is to be issued on an interest-bearing basis, a discount basis, or an interest-bearing and discount basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regulations on the conditions under which the obligation will be offered for sale, including whether it will be offered for sale on a competitive or other basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the offering price and interest rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the method of computing the interest rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the dates for paying principal and interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the form and denominations of the obligations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) other conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation issued under this chapter and redeemable on demand of the owner or holder may be used to pay the United States Government for taxes imposed by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligation of the Government issued after March 3, 1971, under law may not be redeemed before its maturity to pay a tax imposed by the Government in an amount more than the fair market value of the obligation at the time of its redemption. This paragraph does not apply to a Treasury bill issued under section 3104 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation authorized by this chapter may be issued in exchange for an obligation of an agency whose principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the Government at or before maturity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may issue registered bonds in exchange for and instead of coupon bonds that have been or may be issued. The registered bonds shall be similar in all respects to the registered bonds issued under a law authorizing the issue of coupon bonds offered for exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A decision of the Secretary about an issue of obligations under sections 3102–3104 of this title is final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may accept voluntary services in carrying out the sale of public debt obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In this subsection, “registration-required obligation” means an obligation except an obligation—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not of a type offered to the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) having a maturity (at issue) of not more than one year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligation is not a registration-required obligation if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are arrangements reasonably designed to ensure that the obligation will be sold (or resold in connection with the original issue) only to a person that is not a United States person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for an obligation not in registered form—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) interest on the obligation is payable only outside the United States and its territories and possessions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a statement is on the face of the obligation that a United States person holding the obligation is subject to limitations under the United States income tax laws.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Every registration-required obligation of the Government shall be in registered form. A book entry obligation is deemed to be in registered form if the right to principal and stated interest on the obligation may be transferred only through a book entry consistent with regulations of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out this subsection when there is a nominee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation standards for the safeguarding and use of obligations issued under this chapter, and obligations otherwise issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States. Such regulations shall apply only to a depository institution that is not a government securities broker or a government securities dealer and that holds such obligations as fiduciary, custodian, or otherwise for the account of a customer and not for its own account. Such regulations shall provide for the adequate segregation of obligations so held, including obligations which are purchased or sold subject to resale or repurchase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Violation of a regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under section 5239(a) or (b) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 93(a) or (b)), section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 5(d)(2) or 5(d)(3) <sup><a href="#3121_1_target" name="3121_1">1</a></sup> of the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933, section 407(e) or 407(f) <sup><a href="#3121_1_target" name="3121_1">1</a></sup> of the National Housing Act, or section 206(e) or 206(f) of the Federal Credit Union Act. Such an order may be issued with respect to a depository institution by its appropriate regulatory agency and with respect to a federally insured credit union by the National Credit Union Administration Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect in any way the powers of such agencies under any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall, prior to adopting regulations under this subsection, determine with respect to each appropriate regulatory agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board, whether its rules and standards adequately meet the purposes of regulations to be promulgated under this subsection, and if the Secretary so determines, shall exempt any depository institution subject to such rules or standards from the regulations promulgated under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) “depository institution” has the meaning stated in clauses (i) through (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act and also includes a foreign bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank, and a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in the International Banking Act of 1978).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) “government securities broker” has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(43) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) “government securities dealer” has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) “appropriate regulatory agency” has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(34)(G) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a nondiscriminatory franchise tax or another nonproperty tax instead of a franchise tax, imposed on a corporation; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The tax status of interest on obligations and dividends, earnings, or other income from evidences of ownership issued by the Government or an agency and the tax treatment of gain and loss from the disposition of those obligations and evidences of ownership is decided under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.). An obligation that the Federal Housing Administration had agreed, under a contract made before March 1, 1941, to issue at a future date, has the tax exemption privileges provided by the authorizing law at the time of the contract. This subsection does not apply to obligations and evidences of ownership issued by the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a department, agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of the District, territory, or possession.</p>

A Federal reserve bank, a paying agent allowed to make payments in redeeming a bond or note, or an officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury is relieved from liability to the United States Government for the loss when the Secretary decides that the loss did not result from the fault or negligence of the bank, paying agent, officer, or employee. The Secretary shall relieve the bank, agent, officer, or employee from liability when the Secretary decides that written notice of liability or potential liability has not been given to the bank, agent, officer, or employee by the Government within 10 years from the date of the erroneous payment.

<p class="note-body">Section 3618 (1st sentence related to non-military deposits) of the Revised Statutes inadvertently was omitted as a source credit for 31:3302. Table 2A of H. Rep. 97–651 (p. 298) states that the sentence was omitted as superseded by various sections of title 10. Title 10 supersedes the sentence only as it applies to military deposits. However, the language of section 3618 (1st sentence related to non-military deposits) is subsumed in the broader language of section 3617 of the Revised Statutes, the source credit for 31:3302(b). Therefore, while section 3618 (1st sentence related to non-military deposits) should be a source credit for 31:3302(b), it is not necessary that the language of the sentence be restated.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section uses the defined term “executive agency” in section 102 of the revised title because the source provisions of this section are from a reorganization plan and executive orders that apply only to departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the executive branch of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b), the words “Secretary of the Treasury” and “Secretary” are substituted for references to the Division of Disbursement and a Chief Disbursing Officer because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The words “public money” are substituted for “moneys of the United States” for consistency with the other source provisions restated in the section and for consistency in the chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is substituted for section 4(1st paragraph) of Executive Order No. 6166 to omit executed words.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words “may require” and “as the interests of” are omitted as unnecessary. The words “to establish local offices” are omitted because of the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury as the head of the Department of the Treasury and the authority of the Secretary under section 321 of the revised title. The text of section 4(last paragraph) is omitted as superseded by section 3325 of the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the text of 31:492–1(1st sentence) is applied only to the listed agencies because of subsection (a) and Executive Order 6728. The text of 31:492–1(last sentence) is omitted as superseded by section 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950 (eff. July 1, 1950, 64 Stat. 1270) and by 40:490. In clause (1), the words after “disbursement by United States marshals” and before the last proviso in section 3 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1940 (eff. June 30, 1940, 54 Stat. 1234) are omitted as unnecessary because of 28:571 and sections 3512(a)–(c) and 3513(a) of the revised title. In clause (2), the word “pay” is substituted for “salaries” in Executive Order No. 6728 for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “including the Marine Corps” are omitted as being included in “military departments”. The words “Panama Canal” are omitted because of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977. The first proviso is omitted as unnecessary because of sections 3512 and 3513 of the revised title. Section 4 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1940 is omitted because (1) the Post Office Department was abolished by the 1970 restatement of title 39, with all authority of the former Postmaster General being placed in the new United States Postal Service, (2) under 39:410 and 3604, the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission were exempt from all provisions of law related to budget and funds, and (3) the Postal Savings System and its Board of Trustees were abolished under section 5 of the Act of March 28, 1942 (ch. 205, 56 Stat. 189).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13520. Reducing Improper Payments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13520, Nov. 20, 2009, 74 F.R. 62201, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in the interest of reducing payment errors and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal programs, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Purpose</em>. When the Federal Government makes payments to individuals and businesses as program beneficiaries, grantees, or contractors, or on behalf of program beneficiaries, it must make every effort to confirm that the right recipient is receiving the right payment for the right reason at the right time. The purpose of this order is to reduce improper payments by intensifying efforts to eliminate payment error, waste, fraud, and abuse in the major programs administered by the Federal Government, while continuing to ensure that Federal programs serve and provide access to their intended beneficiaries. No single step will fully achieve these goals. Therefore, this order adopts a comprehensive set of policies, including transparency and public scrutiny of significant payment errors throughout the Federal Government; a focus on identifying and eliminating the highest improper payments; accountability for reducing improper payments among executive branch agencies and officials; and coordinated Federal, State, and local government action in identifying and eliminating improper payments. Because this order targets error, waste, fraud, and abuse—not legitimate use of Government services—efforts to reduce improper payments under this order must protect access to Federal programs by their intended beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Transparency and Public Participation</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) identify Federal programs in which the highest dollar value or majority of Government-wide improper payments occur (high-priority programs);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) establish, in coordination with the executive department or agency (agency) responsible for administering the high-priority program annual or semi-annual targets (or where such targets already exist, supplemental targets), as appropriate, for reducing improper payments associated with each high-priority program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) issue Government-wide guidance on the implementation of this order, including procedures for identifying and publicizing the list of entities described in subsection (b)(v) of this section and for administrative appeal of the decision to publish the identity of those entities, prior to publication; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) establish a working group consisting of Federal, State, and local officials to make recommendations to the Director of OMB designed to improve the Federal Government's measurement of access to Federal programs by the programs’ intended beneficiaries. The working group's recommendations shall be prepared in consultation with the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) and submitted within 180 days of the date of this order, and the recommended measurements may be incorporated by the Secretary of the Treasury in the information published pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury in coordination with the Attorney General and the Director of OMB, shall publish on the Internet information about improper payments under high-priority programs. The information shall include, subject to Federal privacy policies and to the extent permitted by law:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) the names of the accountable officials designated under section 3 of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) current and historical rates and amounts of improper payments, including, where known and appropriate, causes of the improper payments;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) current and historical rates and amounts of recovery of improper payments, where appropriate (or, where improper payments are identified solely on the basis of a sample, recovery rates and amounts estimated on the basis of the applicable sample);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) targets for reducing as well as recovering improper payments, where appropriate; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(v) the entities that have received the greatest amount of outstanding improper payments (or, where improper payments are identified solely on the basis of a sample, the entities that have received the greatest amount of outstanding improper payments in the applicable sample).</p>
<p class="note-body">Information on entities that have received the greatest amount of outstanding improper payments shall not include any referrals the agency made or anticipates making to the Department of Justice, or any information provided in connection with such referrals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury in coordination with the Attorney General and the Director of OMB and in consultation with the CIGIE, shall establish a central Internet-based method to collect from the public information concerning suspected incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse by an entity receiving Federal funds that have led or may lead to improper payments by the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies shall place a prominently displayed link to Internet-based resources for addressing improper payments, including the resources established under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, on their Internet home pages.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Agency Accountability and Coordination</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency responsible for operating a high-priority program shall designate an official who holds an existing Senate-confirmed position to be accountable for meeting the targets established under section 2 of this order without unduly burdening program access and participation by eligible beneficiaries. In those agencies where the majority of payments are isolated to a single component, the head of the agency shall name a second accountable official for that component whose sole responsibility would be for program integrity activities and, as appropriate, shall consolidate and coordinate all program integrity activities within the component.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, each agency official designated under subsection (a) of this section, or otherwise designated by the Director of OMB, shall provide the agency's Inspector General a report containing:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) the agency's methodology for identifying and measuring improper payments by the agency's high-priority programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) the agency's plans, together with supporting analysis, for meeting the reduction targets for improper payments in the agency's high-priority programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) the agency's plan, together with supporting analysis, for ensuring that initiatives undertaken pursuant to this order do not unduly burden program access and participation by eligible beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="note-body">Following the receipt and review of this information, the agency Inspector General shall assess the level of risk associated with the applicable programs, determine the extent of oversight warranted, and provide the agency head with recommendations, if any, for modifying the agency's methodology, improper payment reduction plans, or program access and participation plans.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) If an agency fails to meet the targets established under section 2 of this order or implement the plan described in subsection (b)(iii) of this section for 2 consecutive years, that agency's accountable official designated under subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the agency head, Inspector General, and Chief Financial Officer a report describing the likely causes of the agency's failure and proposing a remedial plan. The agency head shall review this plan and, in consultation with the Inspector General and Chief Financial Officer, forward the plan with any additional comments and analysis to the Director of OMB.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC) in consultation with the CIGIE, the Department of Justice, and program experts, shall make recommendations to the Director of OMB and the Secretary of the Treasury on actions (including actions related to forensic accounting and audits) agencies should take to more effectively tailor their methodologies for identifying and measuring improper payments to those programs, or components of programs, where improper payments are most likely to occur. Recommendations shall address the manner in which the recommended actions would affect program access and participation by eligible beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of OMB in consultation with the CIGIE, the Department of Justice, and program experts, shall recommend to the President actions designed to reduce improper payments by improving information sharing among agencies and programs, and where applicable, State and local governments and other stakeholders. The recommendations shall address the ways in which information sharing may improve eligibility verification and pre-payment scrutiny, shall identify legal or regulatory impediments to effective information sharing, and shall address the manner in which the recommended actions would affect program access and participation by eligible beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Within 180 days of the date of this order, and at least once every quarter thereafter, the head of each agency shall submit to the agency's Inspector General and the CIGIE, and make available to the public, a report on any high-dollar improper payments identified by the agency, subject to Federal privacy policies and to the extent permitted by law. The report shall describe any actions the agency has taken or plans to take to recover improper payments, as well as any actions the agency intends to take to prevent improper payments from occurring in the future. The report shall not include any referrals the agency made or anticipates making to the Department of Justice, or any information provided in connection with such referrals. Following the review of each report, the agency Inspector General and the CIGIE shall assess the level of risk associated with the applicable program, determine the extent of oversight warranted, and provide the agency head with recommendations, if any, for modifying the agency's plans.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Enhanced Focus on Contractors and Working with State and Local Stakeholders</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in coordination with the Director of OMB, and in consultation with the National Procurement Fraud Task Force (or its successor group), the CIGIE, and appropriate agency officials, shall recommend to the President actions designed to enhance contractor accountability for improper payments. The recommendations may include, but are not limited to, subjecting contractors to debarment, suspension, financial penalties, and identification through a public Internet website, subject to Federal privacy policies and to the extent permitted by law and where the identification would not interfere with or compromise an ongoing criminal or civil investigation, for knowingly failing timely to disclose credible evidence of significant overpayments received on Government contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB shall establish a working group consisting of Federal and elected State and local officials to make recommendations to the Director of OMB designed to improve the effectiveness of single audits of State and local governments and non-profit organizations that are expending Federal funds. The Director of OMB may designate an appropriate official to serve as Chair of the working group to convene its meetings and direct its work. The working group's recommendations shall be prepared in consultation with the CIGIE and submitted within 180 days of the date of this order. The recommendations shall address, among other things, the effectiveness of single audits in identifying improper payments and opportunities to streamline or eliminate single audit requirements where their value is minimal.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB shall establish a working group (which may be separate from the group established under subsection (b) of this section) consisting of Federal and elected State and local officials to make recommendations to the Director of OMB for administrative actions designed to improve the incentives and accountability of State and local governments, as well as other entities receiving Federal funds, for reducing improper payments. The Director of OMB may designate an appropriate official to serve as Chair of the working group to convene its meetings and direct its work. The working group's recommendations shall be prepared in consultation with the CIGIE and submitted within 180 days of the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Policy Proposals</em>. The Director of OMB, in consultation with the appropriate agencies and the CIGIE, shall develop policy recommendations, including potential legislative proposals, designed to reduce improper payments, including those caused by error, waste, fraud, and abuse, across Federal programs without compromising program access, to be included, as appropriate, in the Budget of the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2011 and future years, or other Administration proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>General Provisions</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law to a department, agency, the head thereof, or any agency Inspector General; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to require the disclosure of classified information, law enforcement sensitive information, or other information that must be protected in the interests of national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before clause (1), the words “Secretary of the Treasury” are substituted for “Treasurer of the United States” because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title.

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the Secretary is satisfied that an original check drawn on a depositary in a foreign country or a territory or possession of the United States is lost, stolen, destroyed in part, or is so defaced that its value to the owner or holder is impaired, the drawer of the original check (or another official designated by the Secretary with the approval of the head of the agency on whose behalf the original check was issued) may issue to the owner or holder of the check a substitute check.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) received under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the check was negotiated later and paid by the Secretary or a depositary on a forged endorsement of the payee's or special endorsee's name; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall deposit immediately to the credit of the Fund an amount recovered from a forger or a transferee or party on the check. The Secretary may use amounts in the Fund to reimburse payment certifying or authorizing agencies for any payment that the Secretary determines would otherwise have been payable from the Fund, and may reimburse certifying or authorizing agencies with amounts recovered because of payee nonentitlement. However, currency of a foreign country recovered because of a forged check drawn on a designated depositary shall be credited to the Fund or to the foreign currency fund that was charged when payment was made under subsection (b) of this section to the payee or special endorsee.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE[.]</h4>
<p class="note-body">“This title may be cited as the ‘Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996.’</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 802. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress has been made in recent years, Federal accounting standards have not been uniformly implemented in financial management systems for agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal practices have failed to—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(A) identify costs fully;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(C) accurately report the financial condition of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately report financial results of the Federal Government or the full costs of programs and activities. The continued use of these practices undermines the Government's ability to provide credible and reliable financial data and encourages already widespread Government waste, and will not assist in achieving a balanced budget.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government undermine the confidence of the American people in the government and reduce the federal Government's ability to address vital public needs adequately.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the Federal Government, agencies must incorporate accounting standards and reporting objectives established for the Federal Government into their financial management systems so that all the assets and liabilities, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, and the full costs of programs and activities of the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to as the ‘FASAB’) has made substantial progress toward developing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting concepts and standards for the Federal Government. When the accounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB are incorporated into Federal financial management systems, agencies will be able to provide cost and financial information that will assist the Congress and financial managers to evaluate the cost and performance of Federal programs and activities, and will therefore provide important information that has been lacking, but is needed for improved decision making by financial managers and the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) The development of financial management systems with the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, over the long term, improve Federal financial management.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>[.]—The purposes of this Act [title] are to—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standards throughout the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) require Federal financial management systems to support full disclosure of Federal financial data, including the full costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, and agency management, so that programs and activities can be considered based on their full costs and merits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) increase the accountability and credibility of federal [sic] financial management;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of Federal Government financial management;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) establish financial management systems to support controlling the cost of Federal Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–576; 104 Stat 2838) [see Short Title of 1990 Amendment note set out under section 501 of this title], the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–62[;] 107 Stat. 285) [see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note set out under section 1101 of this title] and the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–356; 108 Stat. 3410) [see Short Title of 1994 Amendment note set out under section 3301 of this title]; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor execution of the budget by more readily permitting reports that compare spending of resources to results of activities.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 803. IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENTS.</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Comptroller General shall settle all accounts of the United States Government and supervise the recovery of all debts finally certified by the Comptroller General as due the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A decision of the Comptroller General under section 3529 of this title is conclusive on the Comptroller General when settling the account containing the payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Comptroller General shall settle an account of an accountable official within 3 years after the date the Comptroller General receives the account. A copy of the certificate of settlement shall be provided the official.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The settlement of an account is conclusive on the Comptroller General after 3 years after the account is received by the Comptroller General. However, an amount may be charged against the account after the 3-year period when the Government has or may have lost money because the official acted fraudulently or criminally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A 3-year period under this subsection is suspended during a war.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not prohibit—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) recovery of public money illegally or erroneously paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recovery from an official of a balance due the Government under a settlement within the 3-year period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an official from clearing an account of questioned items as prescribed by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) On settling an account of the Government, the balance certified by the Comptroller General is conclusive on the executive branch of the Government. On the initiative of the Comptroller General or on request of an individual whose accounts are settled or the head of the agency to which the account relates, the Comptroller General may change the account within a year after settlement. The decision of the Comptroller General to change the account is conclusive on the executive branch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When an amount of money is expended under law for a treaty or relations with a foreign country, the President may—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) authorize the amount to be accounted for each year specifically by settlement of the Comptroller General when the President decides the amount expended may be made public; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make, or have the Secretary of State make, a certificate of the amount expended if the President decides the amount is not to be accounted for specifically. The certificate is a sufficient voucher for the amount stated in the certificate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Comptroller General shall keep all settled accounts, vouchers, certificates, and related papers until they are disposed of as prescribed by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) This subchapter does not prohibit the Comptroller General from suspending an item in an account to get additional evidence or explanations needed to settle an account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Comptroller General, upon a showing by the Federal agency, determines (and states the reasons in writing) that the specific circumstances of the protest require a longer period, within the longer period determined by the Comptroller General; or</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) After trying to collect a claim from a person under section 3711(a) of this title, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may collect the claim by administrative offset. The head of the agency may collect by administrative offset only after giving the debtor—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) written notice of the type and amount of the claim, the intention of the head of the agency to collect the claim by administrative offset, and an explanation of the rights of the debtor under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the agency related to the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an opportunity for a review within the agency of the decision of the agency related to the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Before collecting a claim by administrative offset, the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency must either—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) adopt, without change, regulations on collecting by administrative offset promulgated by the Department of Justice, the Government Accountability Office, or the Department of the Treasury; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prescribe regulations on collecting by administrative offset consistent with the regulations referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1)(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a disbursing official of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, or any other government corporation, or any disbursing official of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall offset at least annually the amount of a payment which a payment certifying agency has certified to the disbursing official for disbursement, by an amount equal to the amount of a claim which a creditor agency has certified to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An agency that designates disbursing officials pursuant to section 3321(c) of this title is not required to certify claims arising out of its operations to the Secretary of the Treasury before such agency's disbursing officials offset such claims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Payments certified by the Department of Education under a program administered by the Secretary of Education under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall not be subject to administrative offset under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Neither the disbursing official nor the payment certifying agency shall be liable—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for the amount of the administrative offset on the basis that the underlying obligation, represented by the payment before the administrative offset was taken, was not satisfied; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for failure to provide timely notice under paragraph (8).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including sections 207 and 1631(d)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 407 and 1383(d)(1)), section 413(b) of Public Law 91–173 (30 U.S.C. 923(b)), and section 14 of the Act of August 29, 1935 (45 U.S.C. 231m)), except as provided in clause (ii), all payments due to an individual under—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Social Security Act,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than payments that such Board determines to be tier 2 benefits),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be subject to offset under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) An amount of $9,000 which a debtor may receive under Federal benefit programs cited under clause (i) within a 12-month period shall be exempt from offset under this subsection. In applying the $9,000 exemption, the disbursing official shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) reduce the $9,000 exemption amount for the 12-month period by the amount of all Federal benefit payments made during such 12-month period which are not subject to offset under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) apply a prorated amount of the exemption to each periodic benefit payment to be made to the debtor during the applicable 12-month period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of a periodic benefit payment shall be the amount after any reduction or deduction required under the laws authorizing the program under which such payment is authorized to be made (including any reduction or deduction to recover any overpayment under such program).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt from administrative offset under this subsection payments under means-tested programs when requested by the head of the respective agency. The Secretary may exempt other payments from administrative offset under this subsection upon the written request of the head of a payment certifying agency. A written request for exemption of other payments must provide justification for the exemption under standards prescribed by the Secretary. Such standards shall give due consideration to whether administrative offset would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment certifying agency's program. The Secretary shall report to the Congress annually on exemptions granted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The provisions of sections 205(b)(1), 809(a)(1), and 1631(c)(1) of the Social Security Act shall not apply to any administrative offset executed pursuant to this section against benefits authorized by title II, VIII, or title XVI of the Social Security Act, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This section shall apply to payments made after the date which is 90 days after the enactment of this subparagraph (or such earlier date as designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services) with respect to claims or debts, and to amounts payable, under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing this subsection. The fee may be collected either by the retention of a portion of amounts collected pursuant to this subsection, or by billing the agency referring or transferring a claim for those amounts. Fees charged to the agencies shall be based on actual administrative offsets completed. Amounts received by the United States as fees under this subsection shall be deposited into the account of the Department of the Treasury under section 3711(g)(7) of this title, and shall be collected and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Commissioner of Social Security and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may prescribe such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary of the Treasury considers necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary shall consult with the heads of affected agencies in the development of such rules, regulations, and procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any Federal agency that is owed by a person a past due, legally enforceable nontax debt that is over 180 days delinquent, including nontax debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government, shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of all such nontax debts for purposes of administrative offset under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The disbursing official conducting an administrative offset with respect to a payment to a payee shall notify the payee in writing of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the occurrence of the administrative offset to satisfy a past due legally enforceable debt, including a description of the type and amount of the payment otherwise payable to the payee against which the offset was executed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the payment to be offset is a periodic benefit payment, the disbursing official shall take reasonable steps, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide the notice to the payee not later than the date on which the payee is otherwise scheduled to receive the payment, or as soon as practical thereafter, but no later than the date of the administrative offset. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the failure of the debtor to receive such notice shall not impair the legality of such administrative offset.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over requests for administrative offset pursuant to other laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the use of any other administrative offset authority existing under statute or common law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, regulation, or administrative limitation, no limitation on the period within which an offset may be initiated or taken pursuant to this section shall be effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not apply when a statute explicitly prohibits using administrative offset or setoff to collect the claim or type of claim involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may waive the requirements of sections 552a(<em>o</em>) and (p) of title 5 for administrative offset or claims collection upon written certification by the head of a State or an executive, judicial, or legislative agency seeking to collect the claim that the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have been met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury established under 552a(u) of title 5 shall review and include in reports under paragraph (3)(D) of that section a description of any matching activities conducted under this section. If the Secretary has granted a waiver under subsection (f) of this section, no other Data Integrity Board is required to take any action under section 552a(u) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, apply subsection (a) with respect to any past-due, legally-enforceable debt owed to a State if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the appropriate State disbursing official requests that an offset be performed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a reciprocal agreement with the State is in effect which contains, at a minimum—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) requirements substantially equivalent to subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) any other requirements which the Secretary considers appropriate to facilitate the offset and prevent duplicative efforts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection does not apply to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the collection of a debt or claim on which the administrative costs associated with the collection of the debt or claim exceed the amount of the debt or claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any collection of any other type, class, or amount of claim, as the Secretary considers necessary to protect the interest of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the disbursement of any class or type of payment exempted by the Secretary of the Treasury at the request of a Federal agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In applying this section with respect to any debt owed to a State, subsection (c)(3)(A) shall not apply.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13019, Sept. 28, 1996, 61 F.R. 51763, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, Public Law 104–134 [§31001] (110 Stat. 1321–358 <em>et seq</em>.) [see Short Title of 1996 Amendment note set out under section 3701 of this title], was enacted into law on April 26, 1996, as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996. While the primary purpose of the Debt Collection Improvement Act is to increase the collection of nontax debts owed to the Federal Government, the Act also contains important provisions that can be used to assist families in collecting past-due child support obligations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The failure of some parents to meet their child support obligations threatens the health, education, and well-being of their children. Compounding this problem, States have experienced difficulties enforcing child support obligations once a parent has moved to another State. With this Executive order, my Administration takes additional steps to support our children and strengthen American families by facilitating the collection of delinquent child support obligations from persons who may be entitled or eligible to receive certain Federal payments or Federal assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Administrative Offsets</em>. (a)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury (“the Secretary”), in accordance with the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and to the extent permitted by law, and in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly develop and implement procedures necessary for the Secretary to collect past-due child support debts by administrative offset, and shall issue such rules, regulations, and procedures as the Secretary, in consultation with the heads of affected agencies, deems appropriate to govern administrative offsets by the Department of the Treasury and other executive departments and agencies that disburse Federal payments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The Secretary may enter into reciprocal agreements with States concerning the collection by the Secretary of delinquent child support debts through administrative offsets.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, within 120 days of the date of this order, implement procedures necessary to report to the Secretary of the Treasury information on past-due child support claims referred by States (including claims enforced by States pursuant to cooperative agreements with or by Indian tribal governments) to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies payments to the Secretary or to another disbursing official shall review each class of payments that the department or agency certifies to determine if any such class should be exempt from offset and, if any class is so identified, submit to the Secretary a request for such an exemption together with the reasons therefor. With respect to classes of payments under means-tested programs existing on the date of this order, such submission shall be made within 30 days of the date of this order. With respect to classes of payments other than payments under means-tested programs existing on the date of this order, such submissions shall be made within 30 days of the date the Secretary establishes standards pursuant to section 3716(c)(3) of title 31, United States Code. With respect to a class of payments established after the date of this order, such submissions shall be made not later than 30 days after such class is established.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The head of each executive department and agency that certifies payments to the Secretary shall promptly implement any rule, regulation, or procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The head of each executive department and agency that is authorized by law to disburse payments shall promptly implement any rule, regulation, or procedure issued by the Secretary pursuant to this section and shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) match, consistent with computer privacy matching laws, the payment certification records of such department or agency with records of persons delinquent in child support payments as directed by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) conduct administrative offsets to collect delinquent child support payments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, share with the Secretary of Health and Human Services any information contained in payment certification records of persons who are delinquent in child support obligations that would assist in the collection of such debts, whether or not an administrative offset is conducted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Denial of Federal Assistance</em>. (a) The Secretary shall, to the extent permitted by law, ensure that information concerning individuals whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of delinquent child support obligations is made available to the head of each executive department and agency that provides Federal financial assistance to individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In conformance with section 2(e) of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall, with respect to any individuals whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of a delinquent child support obligation, promptly implement procedures to deny Federal financial assistance to such individuals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other affected agencies, shall promptly issue guidelines for departments and agencies concerning minimum due-process standards to be included in the procedures required by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) For purposes of this section, Federal financial assistance means any Federal loan (other than a disaster loan), loan guarantee, or loan insurance.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e)(1) A class of Federal financial assistance shall not be subject to denial if the head of the concerned department or agency determines:</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that such action:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) is not permitted by law; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) would likely result in valid legal claims for damages against the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) that such action would be inconsistent with the best interests of the child or children with respect to whom a child support obligation is owed; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) that such action should be waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The head of each executive department and agency shall provide written notification to the Secretary upon determining that the denial of a class of Federal financial assistance is not permitted by law or should be waived.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The head of each executive department and agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) review all laws under the jurisdiction of the department or agency that do not permit the denial of Federal financial assistance to individuals and whose payments are subject to administrative offset because of a delinquent child support obligation and, where appropriate, transmit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget recommendations for statutory changes; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) to the extent practicable, review all rules, regulations, and procedures implementing laws under the jurisdiction of the department or agency governing the provision of any Federal financial assistance to individuals and, where appropriate, conform such rules, regulations, and procedures to the provisions of this order and the rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Reports</em>. (a) The head of each executive department and agency shall provide to the Secretary such information as the Secretary may request concerning the implementation of this order, the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 applicable to delinquent child support obligations, and the rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall report annually to the President concerning the implementation by departments and agencies of this order and the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 applicable to delinquent child support obligations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The rate of interest charged under subsection (a) of this section—</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) The head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may increase an administrative claim by the cost of living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this section. Adjustments under this subsection will be computed annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of this subsection—</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under conditions the head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency considers appropriate, the head of the agency may enter into a contract with a person for collection service to recover indebtedness owed, or to locate or recover assets of, the United States Government. The head of an agency may not enter into a contract under the preceding sentence to locate or recover assets of the United States held by a State government or financial institution unless that agency has established procedures approved by the Secretary of the Treasury to identify and recover such assets. The contract shall provide that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the head of the agency retains the authority to resolve a dispute, compromise a claim, end collection action, and refer a matter to the Attorney General to bring a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person is subject to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) section 552a of title 5, to the extent provided in section 552a(m); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) laws and regulations of the United States Government and State governments related to debt collection practices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) The Attorney General may make contracts retaining private counsel to furnish legal services, including representation in negotiation, compromise, settlement, and litigation, in the case of any claim of indebtedness owed the United States. Each such contract shall include such terms and conditions as the Attorney General considers necessary and appropriate, including a provision specifying the amount of the fee to be paid to the private counsel under such contract or the method for calculating that fee. The amount of the fee payable for legal services furnished under any such contract may not exceed the fee that counsel engaged in the private practice of law in the area or areas where the legal services are furnished typically charge clients for furnishing legal services in the collection of claims of indebtedness, as determined by the Attorney General, considering the amount, age, and nature of the indebtedness and whether the debtor is an individual or a business entity. Nothing in this subparagraph shall relieve the Attorney General of the competition requirements set forth in title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 and following).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall use his best efforts to enter into contracts under this paragraph with law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and law firms that are qualified HUBZone small business concerns (as defined in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act), so as to enable each agency to comply with paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive, judicial, or legislative agency may, subject to the approval of the Attorney General, refer to a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection claims of indebtedness owed the United States arising out of activities of that agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each agency shall use its best efforts to assure that not less than 10 percent of the amounts of all claims referred to private counsel by that agency under paragraph (2) are referred to law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and law firms that are qualified HUBZone small business concerns. For purposes of this paragraph—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term “law firm owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals” means a law firm that meets the requirements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)(i) and (ii)) and regulations issued under those clauses;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the term “qualified HUBZone small business concern” has the meaning given that term in section 3(p) of the Small Business Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding sections 516, 518(b), 519, and 547(2) of title 28, a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection may represent the United States in litigation in connection with legal services furnished pursuant to the contract entered into with that counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A contract made with a private counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a provision permitting the Attorney General to terminate either the contract or the private counsel's representation of the United States in particular cases if the Attorney General finds that such action is for the convenience of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a provision stating that the head of the executive or <sup><a href="#3718_2_target" name="3718_2">2</a></sup> legislative agency which refers a claim under the contract retains the authority to resolve a dispute regarding the claim, to compromise the claim, or to terminate a collection action on the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a provision requiring the private counsel to transmit monthly to the Attorney General and the head of the executive or <sup><a href="#3718_1_target" name="3718_1">1</a></sup> legislative agency referring a claim under the contract a report on the services relating to the claim rendered under the contract during the month and the progress made during the month in collecting the claim under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of section 803(6) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692a(6)), a private counsel performing legal services pursuant to a contract made under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered to be a debt collector for the purposes of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any counterclaim filed in any action to recover indebtedness owed the United States which is brought on behalf of the United States by private counsel retained under this subsection may not be asserted unless the counterclaim is served directly on the Attorney General or the United States Attorney for the judicial district in which, or embracing the place in which, the action is brought. Such service shall be made in accordance with the rules of procedure of the court in which the action is brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Attorney General shall transmit to the Congress an annual report on the activities of the Department of Justice to recover indebtedness owed the United States which was referred to the Department of Justice for collection. Each such report shall include a list, by agency, of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total number and amounts of claims which were referred for legal services to the Department of Justice and to private counsel under subsection (b) during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to the Department of Justice which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to private counsel under subsection (b)—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which were not collected or otherwise resolved under a contract terminated by the Attorney General during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on which the Attorney General terminated the private counsel's representation during the 1-year period covered by the report without terminating the contract with the private counsel under which the claims were referred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding section 3302(b) of this title, a contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may provide that a fee a person charges to recover indebtedness owed, or to locate or recover assets of, the United States Government is payable from the amount recovered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section is effective only to the extent and in the amount provided in an appropriation law. This limitation does not apply in the case of a contract that authorizes a person to collect a fee as provided in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not apply to the collection of debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In order to assist Congress in determining whether use of private counsel is a cost-effective method of collecting Government debts, the Attorney General shall, following consultation with the Government Accountability Office, maintain and make available to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, statistical data relating to the comparative costs of debt collection by participating United States Attorneys’ Offices and by private counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) No Federal agency may take action pursuant to subsection (a) with respect to any debt until such agency—</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Upon receiving notice from any Federal agency that a named person owes to such agency a past-due legally enforceable debt, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such person. If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall reduce such refunds by an amount equal to the amount of such debt, pay the amount of such reduction to such agency, and notify such agency of the individual's home address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations prescribing the time or times at which agencies must submit notices of past-due legally enforceable debts, the manner in which such notices must be submitted, and the necessary information that must be contained in or accompany the notices.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case in which an individual files for a waiver under section 204(b) of the Social Security Act within the 60-day period referred to in subsection (b)(2), the Commissioner of Social Security shall not certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that the debt is valid under subsection (b)(4) before rendering a decision on the waiver request under such section 204(b). In lieu of payment, pursuant to subsection (c), to the Commissioner of Social Security of the amount of any reduction under this subsection based on an OASDI overpayment, the Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit such amount in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, whichever is certified to the Secretary of the Treasury as appropriate by the Commissioner of Social Security.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Each agency that receives a bill from a carrier or freight forwarder for transporting an individual or property for the United States Government shall verify its correctness (to include transportation rates, freight classifications, or proper combinations thereof), using prepayment audit, prior to payment in accordance with the requirements of this section and regulations prescribed by the Administrator of General Services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator of General Services may exempt bills, a particular mode or modes of transportation, or an agency or subagency from a prepayment audit and verification and in lieu thereof require a postpayment audit, based on cost effectiveness, public interest, or other factors the Administrator considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Expenses for prepayment audits shall be funded by the agency's appropriations used for the transportation services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The audit authority provided to agencies by this section is subject to oversight by the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Administrator may conduct pre- or post-payment audits of transportation bills of any Federal agency. The number and types of bills audited shall be based on the Administrator's judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Administrator shall adjudicate transportation claims which cannot be resolved by the agency procuring the transportation services, or the carrier or freight-forwarder presenting the bill.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A claim under this section shall be allowed only if it is received by the Administrator not later than 3 years (excluding time of war) after the later of the following dates:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The date of accrual of the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The date payment for the transportation is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The date a refund for an overpayment for the transportation is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The date a deduction under subsection (d) of this section is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Not later than 3 years (excluding time of war) after the time a bill is paid, the Government may deduct from an amount subsequently due a carrier or freight forwarder an amount paid on the bill that was greater than the rate allowed under—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a lawful tariff under title 49 or on file with the Secretary of Transportation with respect to foreign air transportation (as defined in section 40102(a) of title 49), the Federal Maritime Commission, or a State transportation authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a lawfully quoted rate subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Expenses of transportation audit postpayment contracts and contract administration, and the expenses of all other transportation audit and audit-related functions conferred upon the Administrator of General Services, shall be financed from overpayments collected from carriers on transportation bills paid by the Government and other similar type refunds, not to exceed collections. Payment to any contractor for audit services shall not exceed 50 percent of the overpayment identified by contract audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) At least annually, and as determined by the Administrator, after making adequate provision for expense of refunds to carriers, transportation audit postpayment contracts, contract administration, and other expenses authorized in subsection (e), overpayments collected by the General Services Administration shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. A report of receipts, disbursements, and transfers (to miscellaneous receipts) pursuant to this section shall be made annually in connection with the budget estimates to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress. This reporting requirement expires December 31, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Administrator may delegate any authority conferred by this section to another agency or agencies if the Administrator determines that such a delegation would be cost-effective or otherwise in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Under regulations the head of an agency prescribes that conform with standards the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes, a bill under this section may be paid before the transportation is completed notwithstanding section 3324 of this title when a carrier or freight forwarder issues the usual document for the transportation. Payment for transportation ordered but not provided may be recovered by deduction or other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) A carrier or freight forwarder may request the Administrator of General Services to review the action of the Administrator if the request is received not later than 6 months (excluding time of war) after the Administrator acts or within the time stated in subsection (c) of this section, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section does not prevent the Comptroller General from conducting an audit under chapter 35 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Administrator of General Services may provide transportation audit and related technical assistance services, on a reimbursable basis, to any other agency. Such reimbursements may be credited to the appropriate revolving fund or appropriation from which the expenses were incurred.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, “assignment” means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a transfer or assignment of any part of a claim against the United States Government or of an interest in the claim; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authorization to receive payment for any part of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An assignment may be made only after a claim is allowed, the amount of the claim is decided, and a warrant for payment of the claim has been issued. The assignment shall specify the warrant, must be made freely, and must be attested to by 2 witnesses. The person making the assignment shall acknowledge it before an official who may acknowledge a deed, and the official shall certify the assignment. The certificate shall state that the official completely explained the assignment when it was acknowledged. An assignment under this subsection is valid for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to an assignment to a financing institution of money due or to become due under a contract providing for payments totaling at least $1,000 when—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract does not forbid an assignment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, the assignment—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is for the entire amount not already paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is made to only one party, except that it may be made to a party as agent or trustee for more than one party participating in the financing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may not be reassigned; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the assignee files a written notice of the assignment and a copy of the assignment with the contracting official or the head of the agency, the surety on a bond on the contract, and any disbursing official for the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) During a war or national emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by law and ended by proclamation or law, a contract with the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy (when carrying out duties and powers formerly carried out by the Atomic Energy Commission), or other agency the President designates may provide, or may be changed without consideration to provide, that a future payment under the contract to an assignee is not subject to reduction or setoff. A payment subsequently due under the contract (even after the war or emergency is ended) shall be paid to the assignee without a reduction or setoff for liability of the assignor—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the Government independent of the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of renegotiation, fine, penalty (except an amount that may be collected or withheld under, or because the assignor does not comply with, the contract), taxes, social security contributions, or withholding or failing to withhold taxes or social security contributions, arising from, or independent of, the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) An assignee under this section does not have to make restitution of, refund, or repay the amount received because of the liability of the assignor to the Government that arises from or is independent of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Government may not collect or reclaim money paid to a person receiving an amount under an assignment or allotment of pay or allowances authorized by law when liability may exist because of the death of the person making the assignment or allotment.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§3730. Civil actions for false claims</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Responsibilities of the Attorney General</cap-smallcap>.—The Attorney General diligently shall investigate a violation under section 3729. If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating section 3729, the Attorney General may bring a civil action under this section against the person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions by Private Persons</cap-smallcap>.—(1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Government pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Government may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under paragraph (2). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) When a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rights of the Parties to Qui Tam Actions</cap-smallcap>.—(1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person has been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Government may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a showing by the Government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Award to Qui Tam Plaintiff</cap-smallcap>.—(1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such person shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government <sup><a href="#3730_1_target" name="3730_1">1</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action, represented by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Certain Actions Barred</cap-smallcap>.—(1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the armed forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service in the armed forces.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under subsection (b) against a Member of Congress, a member of the judiciary, or a senior executive branch official if the action is based on evidence or information known to the Government when the action was brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, “senior executive branch official” means any officer or employee listed in paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 101(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In no event may a person bring an action under subsection (b) which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Government is already a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government <sup><a href="#3730_2_target" name="3730_2">2</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, “original source” means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Government Not Liable for Certain Expenses</cap-smallcap>.—The Government is not liable for expenses which a person incurs in bringing an action under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Fees and Expenses to Prevailing Defendant</cap-smallcap>.—In civil actions brought under this section by the United States, the provisions of section 2412(d) of title 28 shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Relief From Retaliatory Actions.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.—Any employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole, if that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, or agent on behalf of the employee, contractor, or agent or associated others in furtherance of other efforts to stop 1 or more violations of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Relief</cap-smallcap>.—Relief under paragraph (1) shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status that employee, contractor, or agent would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. An action under this subsection may be brought in the appropriate district court of the United States for the relief provided in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this chapter—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) “agency” has the same meaning given that term in section 551(1) of title 5 and includes an entity being operated, and the head of the agency identifies the entity as being operated, only as an instrumentality of the agency to carry out a program of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) “business concern” means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a person carrying on a trade or business; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a nonprofit entity operating as a contractor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) “proper invoice” is an invoice containing or accompanied by substantiating documentation the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may require by regulation and the head of the appropriate agency may require by regulation or contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for the purposes of determining a payment due date and the date upon which any late payment interest penalty shall begin to accrue, the head of the agency is deemed to receive an invoice—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on the later of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the date on which the place or person designated by the agency to first receive such invoice actually receives a proper invoice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) on the 7th day after the date on which, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the property is actually delivered or performance of the services is actually completed, as the case may be, unless—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the agency has actually accepted such property or services before such 7th day; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the contract (except in the case of a contract for the procurement of a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale) specifies a longer acceptance period, as determined by the contracting officer to be required to afford the agency a practicable opportunity to inspect and test the property furnished or evaluate the services performed; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the date of the invoice, if the agency has failed to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of actual receipt by the place or person designated by the agency to first receive such invoice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a payment is deemed to be made on the date a check for payment is dated or an electronic fund transfer is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a contract to rent property is deemed to be a contract to acquire the property.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) This chapter applies to the Tennessee Valley Authority. However, regulations prescribed under this chapter do not apply to the Authority, and the Authority alone is responsible for carrying out this chapter as it applies to contracts of the Authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This chapter applies to the United States Postal Service. However, the Postmaster General shall be responsible for issuing the implementing procurement regulations, solicitation provisions, and contract clauses for the United States Postal Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, this chapter, except section 3907 of this title, applies to the District of Columbia Courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A claim for an interest penalty not paid under this chapter may be filed in the same manner as claims are filed with respect to contracts to provide property or services for the District of Columbia Courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an interest penalty under this chapter does not continue to accrue for more than one year or after a claim for an interest penalty is filed in the manner described in paragraph (2), whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a claim for an interest penalty is filed in the manner described in paragraph (2) and interest is not available for such claims under the laws and regulations governing claims under contracts to provide property or services for the District of Columbia Courts, interest will accrue under this chapter as provided in paragraph (A) and from the date the claim is filed until the date the claim is paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (3) of this subsection does not prevent an interest penalty from accruing on a claim if such interest is available for such claim under the laws and regulations governing claims under contracts to provide property or services for the District of Columbia Courts. Such interest may accrue on an unpaid contract payment and on the unpaid penalty under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Except as provided in section 3904 of this title, this chapter does not require an interest penalty on a payment that is not made because of a dispute between the head of an agency and a business concern over the amount of payment or compliance with the contract. A claim related to the dispute, and any interest payable for the period during which the dispute is being resolved, is subject to the laws and regulations governing claims under contracts to provide property or services for the District of Columbia Courts.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">§3902. Interest penalties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed under section 3903 of this title, the head of an agency acquiring property or service from a business concern, who does not pay the concern for each complete delivered item of property or service by the required payment date, shall pay an interest penalty to the concern on the amount of the payment due. The interest shall be computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest payments under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611), which is in effect at the time the agency accrues the obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The interest penalty shall be paid for the period beginning on the day after the required payment date and ending on the date on which payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A business concern shall be entitled to an interest penalty of $1.00 or more which is owed such business concern under this section, and such penalty shall be paid without regard to whether the business concern has requested payment of such penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each payment subject to this chapter for which a late payment interest penalty is required to be paid shall be accompanied by a notice stating the amount of the interest penalty included in such payment and the rate by which, and period for which, such penalty was computed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a business concern—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is owed an interest penalty by an agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not paid the interest penalty in a payment made to the business concern by the agency on or after the date on which the interest penalty becomes due;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is not paid the interest penalty by the agency within 10 days after the date on which such payment is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) makes a written demand, not later than 40 days after the date on which such payment is made, that the agency pay such a penalty,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such business concern shall be entitled to an amount equal to the sum of the late payment interest penalty to which the contractor is entitled and an additional penalty equal to a percentage of such late payment interest penalty specified by regulation by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, subject to such maximum as may be specified in such regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely payment due for property or services does not relieve the head of an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An amount of an interest penalty unpaid after any 30-day period shall be added to the principal amount of the debt, and a penalty accrues thereafter on the added amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not authorize the appropriation of additional amounts to pay an interest penalty. The head of an agency shall pay a penalty under this section out of amounts made available to carry out the program for which the penalty is incurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A recipient of a grant from the head of an agency may provide in a contract for the acquisition of property or service from a business concern that, consistent with the usual business practices of the recipient and applicable State and local law, the recipient will pay an interest penalty on amounts overdue under the contract under conditions agreed to by the recipient and the concern. The recipient may not pay the penalty from amounts received from an agency. Amounts expended for the penalty may not be counted toward a matching requirement applicable to the grant. An obligation to pay the penalty is not an obligation of the United States Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) This section shall apply to contracts for the procurement of property or services entered into pursuant to section 4(h) of the Act of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714b(h)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a payment to which producers on a farm are entitled under the terms of an agreement entered into under the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.), an interest penalty shall be paid to the producers if the payment has not been made by the required payment or loan closing date. The interest penalty shall be paid—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on the amount of payment or loan due; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for the period beginning on the first day beginning after the required payment or loan closing date and ending on the date the amount is paid or loaned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) As used in this subsection, the “required payment or loan closing date” means—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for a purchase agreement, the 30th day after delivery of the warehouse receipt for the commodity subject to the purchase agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for a loan agreement, the 30th day beginning after the date of receipt of an application with all requisite documentation and signatures, unless the applicant requests that the disbursement be deferred;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In the event that a contractor, after making a certified payment request to an agency pursuant to section 3903(b) of this title, discovers that a portion or all of such payment request constitutes a payment for performance by such contractor that fails to conform to the specifications, terms, and conditions of its contract (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the “unearned amount”), then the contractor shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notify the agency of such performance deficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be obligated to pay the Government an amount equal to interest on the unearned amount (computed in the manner provided in section 3903(c) of this title), from the date of the contractor's receipt of such unearned amount until—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date the contractor notifies the agency that the performance deficiency has been corrected; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date the contractor reduces the amount of any subsequent certified application for payment to such agency by an amount equal to the unearned amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each construction contract awarded by an agency shall include a clause that requires the prime contractor to include in each subcontract for property or services entered into by the prime contractor and a subcontractor (including a material supplier) for the purpose of performing such construction contract—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a payment clause which obligates the prime contractor to pay the subcontractor for satisfactory performance under its subcontract within 7 days out of such amounts as are paid to the prime contractor by the agency under such contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an interest penalty clause which obligates the prime contractor to pay to the subcontractor an interest penalty on amounts due in the case of each payment not made in accordance with the payment clause included in the subcontract pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the period beginning on the day after the required payment date and ending on the date on which payment of the amount due is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) computed at the rate specified by section 3902(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The construction contract awarded by the agency shall further require the prime contractor to include in each of its subcontracts (for the purpose of performance of such construction contract) a provision requiring the subcontractor to include a payment clause and an interest penalty clause conforming to the standards of subsection (b) of this section in each of its subcontracts and to require each of its subcontractors to include such clauses in their subcontracts with each lower-tier subcontractor or supplier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The clauses required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not be construed to impair the right of a prime contractor or a subcontractor at any tier to negotiate, and to include in their subcontract, provisions which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) permit the prime contractor or a subcontractor to retain (without cause) a specified percentage of each progress payment otherwise due to a subcontractor for satisfactory performance under the subcontract, without incurring any obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty, in accordance with terms and conditions agreed to by the parties to the subcontract, giving such recognition as the parties deem appropriate to the ability of a subcontractor to furnish a performance bond and a payment bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) permit the contractor or subcontractor to make a determination that part or all of the subcontractor's request for payment may be withheld in accordance with the subcontract agreement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) permit such withholding without incurring any obligation to pay a late payment penalty if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a notice conforming to the standards of subsection (g) of this section has been previously furnished to the subcontractor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a copy of any notice issued by a prime contractor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph has been furnished to the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If a prime contractor, after making application to an agency for payment under a contract but before making a payment to a subcontractor for the subcontractor's performance covered by such application, discovers that all or a portion of the payment otherwise due such subcontractor is subject to withholding from the subcontractor in accordance with the subcontract agreement, then the prime contractor shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) furnish to the subcontractor a notice conforming to the standards of subsection (g) of this section as soon as practicable upon ascertaining the cause giving rise to a withholding, but prior to the due date for subcontractor payment;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reduce the subcontractor's progress payment by an amount not to exceed the amount specified in the notice of withholding furnished under paragraph (1) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pay the subcontractor as soon as practicable after the correction of the identified subcontract performance deficiency, and—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make such payment within—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 7 days after correction of the identified subcontract performance deficiency (unless the funds therefor must be recovered from the Government because of a reduction under paragraph (5)(A)); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 7 days after the contractor recovers such funds from the Government; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty computed at the rate specified by section 3902(a) of this title;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) notify the Government, upon—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reduction of the amount of any subsequent certified application for payment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) payment to the subcontractor of any withheld amounts of a progress payment, specifying—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amounts of the progress payments withheld under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the dates that such withholding began and ended; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) be obligated to pay to the Government an amount equal to interest on the withheld payments (computed in the manner provided in section 3903(c) of this title), from the 8th day after receipt of the withheld amounts from the Government until—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the day the identified subcontractor performance deficiency is corrected; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the date that any subsequent payment is reduced under paragraph (5)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) If a prime contractor, after making payment to a first-tier subcontractor, receives from a supplier or subcontractor of the first-tier subcontractor (hereafter referred to as a “second-tier subcontractor”) a written notice in accordance with section 3133(b) of title 40, asserting a deficiency in such first-tier subcontractor's performance under the contract for which the prime contractor may be ultimately liable, and the prime contractor determines that all or a portion of future payments otherwise due such first-tier subcontractor is subject to withholding in accordance with the subcontract agreement, then the prime contractor may, without incurring an obligation to pay an interest penalty under subsection (e)(6) of this section—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) furnish to the first-tier subcontractor a notice conforming to the standards of subsection (g) of this section as soon as practicable upon making such determination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) withhold from the first-tier subcontractor's next available progress payment or payments an amount not to exceed the amount specified in the notice of withholding furnished under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable, but not later than 7 days after receipt of satisfactory written notification that the identified subcontract performance deficiency has been corrected, the prime contractor shall pay the amount withheld under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection to such first-tier subcontractor, or shall incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty to such first-tier subcontractor computed at the rate specified by section 3902(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A written notice of any withholding shall be issued to a subcontractor (with a copy to the Government of any such notice issued by a prime contractor), specifying—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount to be withheld;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the specific causes for the withholding under the terms of the subcontract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the remedial actions to be taken by the subcontractor in order to receive payment of the amounts withheld.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A prime contractor may not request payment from the agency of any amount withheld or retained in accordance with subsection (d) of this section until such time as the prime contractor has determined and certified to the agency that the subcontractor is entitled to the payment of such amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A dispute between a contractor and subcontractor relating to the amount or entitlement of a subcontractor to a payment or a late payment interest penalty under a clause included in the subcontract pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section does not constitute a dispute to which the United States is a party. The United States may not be interpleaded in any judicial or administrative proceeding involving such a dispute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, this section shall not limit or impair any contractual, administrative, or judicial remedies otherwise available to a contractor or a subcontractor in the event of a dispute involving late payment or nonpayment by a prime contractor or deficient subcontract performance or nonperformance by a subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) A contractor's obligation to pay an interest penalty to a subcontractor pursuant to the clauses included in a subcontract under subsection (b) or (c) of this section may not be construed to be an obligation of the United States for such interest penalty. A contract modification may not be made for the purpose of providing reimbursement of such interest penalty. A cost reimbursement claim may not include any amount for reimbursement of such interest penalty.</p>

<p class="note-body">The word “money” is substituted for “money of account” to eliminate unnecessary words. As far as can be determined, the phrase “money of account” has not been interpreted by any court or Government agency. The phrase was used by Alexander Hamilton in his “Report on the Establishment of the Mint” (1791). In that Report, Hamilton propounded 6 questions, including:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em"> 1st. What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thereafter, Hamilton uses the phrases “money unit of the United States” and “money of account” interchangeably and in the sense that the phrases are used to denote the monetary system for keeping financial accounts. In short, the phrases simply indicate that financial accounts are to be based on a decimal money system:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">. . ., and it is certain that nothing can be more simple and convenient than the decimal subdivisions. There is every reason to expect that the method will speedily grow into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding coins. On this plan the unit in the money of account will continue to be, as established by that resolution [of August 8, 1786], a dollar, and its multiples, dimes, cents, and mills, or tenths, hundreths, [sic] and thousands.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thus, the phrase “money of account” did not mean, by itself, that dollars or fractions of dollars must be equal to something having intrinsic or “substantive” value. This concept is supported by earlier writings of Thomas Jefferson in his “Notes on the Establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States” (1784), and the 1782 report to the President of the Continental Congress on the coinage of the United States by the Superintendent of Finances, Robert Morris, which was apparently prepared by the Assistant Superintendent, Gouverneur Morris. See Paul L. Ford, <em>The Writings of Thomas Jefferson</em>, vol. III (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1894) pp. 446–457; William G. Sumner, <em>The Financier and the Finances of the American Revolution</em>, vol. II (Burt Franklin, 1891, reprinted 1970) pp. 36–47; and George T. Curtis, <em>History of the Constitution</em>, vol. I (Harper and Brothers, 1859) p. 443, n2. The words “or units” and “and all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation” are omitted as surplus.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110–456, title I, §101, Dec. 23, 2008, 122 Stat. 5038, provided that: “The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) Yellowstone National Park was established by an Act signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872, as the Nation's first national park.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) The summer and autumn of 1890 saw the establishment of a number of national sites:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(A) August 19: Chickamauga and Chattanooga established as national military parks in Georgia and Tennessee.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(B) August 30: Antietam established as a national battlefield site in Maryland.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(C) September 25: Sequoia National Park established in California.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(D) September 27: Rock Creek Park established in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(E) October 1: General Grant National Park established in California (and subsequently incorporated in Kings Canyon National Park).</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(F) October 1: Yosemite National Park established in California.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) Theodore Roosevelt was this nation's 26th President and is considered by many to be our ‘Conservationist President’.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) As a frequent visitor to the West, Theodore Roosevelt witnessed the virtual destruction of some big game species and the overgrazing that destroyed the grasslands and with them the habitats for small mammals and songbirds and conservation increasingly became one of his major concerns.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) When he became President in 1901, Roosevelt pursued this interest in conservation by establishing the first 51 Bird Reserves, 4 Game Preserves, and 150 National Forests.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) He also established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of 5 National Parks, and signed the Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities in 1906 under which he proclaimed 18 national monuments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) Approximately 230,000,000 acres of area within the United States was placed under public protection by Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(8) Theodore Roosevelt said that nothing short of defending this country in wartime ‘compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us’.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(9) The National Park Service was created by an Act signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(10) The National Park System comprises 391 areas covering more than 84,000,000 acres in every State (except Delaware), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(11) The sites or areas within the National Park System vary widely in size and type from vast natural wilderness to birthplaces of Presidents to world heritage archaeology sites to an African burial ground memorial in Manhattan and include national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(12) In addition to the sites within the National Park System, the United States has placed numerous other types of sites under various forms of conservancy, such as the national forests and sites within the National Wildlife Refuge System and on the National Register of Historic Places.”</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Presidential Commemorative Dollar Coins; Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109–145, title I, §101, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2664, provided that: “Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) There are sectors of the United States economy, including public transportation, parking meters, vending machines, and low-dollar value transactions, in which the use of a $1 coin is both useful and desirable for keeping costs and prices down.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) For a variety of reasons, the new $1 coin introduced in 2000 has not been widely sought-after by the public, leading to higher costs for merchants and thus higher prices for consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) The success of the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (31 U.S.C. 5112(<em>l</em>)) for circulating quarter dollars shows that a design on a United States circulating coin that is regularly changed in a manner similar to the systematic change in designs in such Program radically increases demand for the coin, rapidly pulling it through the economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) The 50 States Commemorative Coin Program also has been an educational tool, teaching both Americans and visitors something about each State for which a quarter has been issued.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) A national survey and study by the Government Accountability Office has indicated that many Americans who do not seek, or who reject, the new $1 coin for use in commerce would actively seek the coin if an attractive, educational rotating design were to be struck on the coin.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) The President is the leader of our tripartite government and the President's spouse has often set the social tone for the White House while spearheading and highlighting important issues for the country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) Sacagawea, as currently represented on the new $1 coin, is an important symbol of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(8) Many people cannot name all of the Presidents, and fewer can name the spouses, nor can many people accurately place each President in the proper time period of American history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(9) First Spouses have not generally been recognized on American coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(10) In order to revitalize the design of United States coinage and return circulating coinage to its position as not only a necessary means of exchange in commerce, but also as an object of aesthetic beauty in its own right, it is appropriate to move many of the mottos and emblems, the inscription of the year, and the so-called ‘mint marks’ that currently appear on the 2 faces of each circulating coin to the edge of the coin, which would allow larger and more dramatic artwork on the coins reminiscent of the so-called ‘Golden Age of Coinage’ in the United States, at the beginning of the Twentieth Century, initiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the assistance of noted sculptors and medallic artists James Earle Fraser and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(11) Placing inscriptions on the edge of coins, known as edge-incusing, is a hallmark of modern coinage and is common in large-volume production of coinage elsewhere in the world, such as the 2,700,000,000 2-Euro coins in circulation, but it has not been done on a large scale in United States coinage in recent years.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(12) Although the Congress has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue gold coins with a purity of 99.99 percent, the Secretary has not done so.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(13) Bullion coins are a valuable tool for the investor and, in some cases, an important aspect of coin collecting.”</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109–145, title III, Dec. 22, 2005, 119 Stat. 2673, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 301. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's history.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 1865.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for accomplishing the ‘American dream’ through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(9) The so-called ‘Lincoln cent’ was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ‘Lincoln cent’, there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's life.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 302. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.—During the year 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following design specifications:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) <cap-smallcap>Obverse</cap-smallcap>.—The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) <cap-smallcap>Reverse</cap-smallcap>.—The reverse of the coins shall bear 4 different designs each representing a different aspect of the life of Abraham Lincoln, such as—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(B) his formative years in Indiana;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(C) his professional life in Illinois; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in</cap-smallcap> 2009.—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) <cap-smallcap>Order</cap-smallcap>.—The 1-cent coins to which this section applies shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) <cap-smallcap>Number</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(c) <cap-smallcap>Design Selection</cap-smallcap>.—The designs for the coins specified in this section shall be chosen by the Secretary—</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 303. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after December 31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 304. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS THE 1909 PENNY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in 2009 with the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin contained in 1909 in such number as the Secretary determines to be appropriate for numismatic purposes.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may make a contract for a period of not more than 4 years to manufacture distinctive paper for United States currency and securities.

The last sentence is substituted for the words following the semicolon in 31:424 for clarity and to reflect the legislative history of the derivative source. See 4 Cong. Rec. 2225–2228, 3148. In that sentence, the words “United States currency (including a Federal reserve note or a circulating note of Federal reserve banks and national banks)” are substituted for “any genuine note of the United States, or of the national banks” for consistency with section 5103 of the revised title.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 7701. IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COOPERATION TO FIGHT TERRORIST FINANCING.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) The global war on terrorism and cutting off terrorist financing is a policy priority for the United States and its partners, working bilaterally and multilaterally through the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council and its committees, such as the 1267 and 1373 Committees, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and various international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the regional multilateral development banks, and other multilateral fora.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) The international financial community has become engaged in the global fight against terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force has focused on the new threat posed by terrorist financing to the international financial system, resulting in the establishment of the FATF's Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing as the international standard on combating terrorist financing. The Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers are developing action plans to curb the financing of terror. In addition, other economic and regional fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and the Western Hemisphere Financial Ministers, have been used to marshal political will and actions in support of combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) FATF's Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing are the recognized global standards for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF has engaged in an assessment process for jurisdictions based on their compliance with these standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) In March 2004, the IMF and IBRD Boards agreed to make permanent a pilot program of collaboration with the FATF to assess global compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. As a result, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) assessments are now a regular part of their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Offshore Financial Center assessments, which provide for a comprehensive analysis of the strength of a jurisdiction's financial system. These reviews assess potential systemic vulnerabilities, consider sectoral development needs and priorities, and review the state of implementation of and compliance with key financial codes and regulatory standards, among them the AML and CFT standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) To date, 70 FSAPs have been conducted, with over 24 of those incorporating AML and CFT assessments. The international financial institutions (IFIs), the FATF, and the FATF-style regional bodies together are expected to assess AML and CFT regimes in up to 40 countries or jurisdictions per year. This will help countries and jurisdictions identify deficiencies in their AML and CFT regimes and help focus technical assistance efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) Technical assistance programs from the United States and other nations, coordinated with the Department of State and other departments and agencies, are playing an important role in helping countries and jurisdictions address shortcomings in their AML and CFT regimes and bringing their regimes into conformity with international standards. Training is coordinated within the United States Government, which leverages multilateral organizations and bodies and international financial institutions to internationalize the conveyance of technical assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) In fulfilling its duties in advancing incorporation of AML and CFT standards into the IFIs as part of the IFIs’ work on protecting the integrity of the international monetary system, the Department of the Treasury, under the guidance of the Secretary of the Treasury, has effectively brought together all of the key United States Government agencies. In particular, United States Government agencies continue to work together to foster broad support for this important undertaking in various multilateral fora, and United States Government agencies recognize the need for close coordination and communication within our own Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress Regarding Success in Multilateral Organizations</cap-smallcap>.—It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to promote the dissemination of international AML and CFT standards, and to press for full implementation of the FATF 40 + 8 Recommendations by all countries in order to curb financial risks and hinder terrorist financing around the globe. The efforts of the Secretary in this regard should include, where necessary or appropriate, multilateral action against countries whose counter-money laundering regimes and efforts against the financing of terrorism fall below recognized international standards.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 7702. DEFINITIONS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“In this subtitle [subtitle G (§§7701–7704) of title VII of Pub. L. 108–458, amending sections 262<em>o</em>–2 and 262r–4 of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse]—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) the term ‘international financial institutions’ has the same meaning as in section 1701(c)(2) of the International Financial Institutions Act [22 U.S.C. 262r(c)(2)];</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) the term ‘Financial Action Task Force’ means the international policy-making and standard-setting body dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorist financing that was created by the Group of Seven in 1989; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) the terms ‘Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System’ and ‘Interagency Paper’ mean the interagency paper prepared by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission that was announced in the Federal Register on April 8, 2003.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">“SEC. 7704. COORDINATION OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT EFFORTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">“The Secretary of the Treasury, or the designee of the Secretary, as the lead United States Government official to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), shall continue to convene the interagency United States Government FATF working group. This group, which includes representatives from all relevant Federal agencies, shall meet at least once a year to advise the Secretary on policies to be pursued by the United States regarding the development of common international AML and CFT standards, to assess the adequacy and implementation of such standards, and to recommend to the Secretary improved or new standards, as necessary.”</p>
<h4 class="note-head">International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001; Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107–56, title III, §302, Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 296, as amended by Pub. L. 108–458, title VI, §6202(c), Dec. 17, 2004, 118 Stat. 3745, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">“(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds that—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) money laundering, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to amount to between 2 and 5 percent of global gross domestic product, which is at least $600,000,000,000 annually, provides the financial fuel that permits transnational criminal enterprises to conduct and expand their operations to the detriment of the safety and security of American citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) money laundering, and the defects in financial transparency on which money launderers rely, are critical to the financing of global terrorism and the provision of funds for terrorist attacks;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) money launderers subvert legitimate financial mechanisms and banking relationships by using them as protective covering for the movement of criminal proceeds and the financing of crime and terrorism, and, by so doing, can threaten the safety of United States citizens and undermine the integrity of United States financial institutions and of the global financial and trading systems upon which prosperity and growth depend;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) certain jurisdictions outside of the United States that offer ‘offshore’ banking and related facilities designed to provide anonymity, coupled with weak financial supervisory and enforcement regimes, provide essential tools to disguise ownership and movement of criminal funds derived from, or used to commit, offenses ranging from narcotics trafficking, terrorism, arms smuggling, and trafficking in human beings, to financial frauds that prey on law-abiding citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) transactions involving such offshore jurisdictions make it difficult for law enforcement officials and regulators to follow the trail of money earned by criminals, organized international criminal enterprises, and global terrorist organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) correspondent banking facilities are one of the banking mechanisms susceptible in some circumstances to manipulation by foreign banks to permit the laundering of funds by hiding the identity of real parties in interest to financial transactions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) private banking services can be susceptible to manipulation by money launderers, for example corrupt foreign government officials, particularly if those services include the creation of offshore accounts and facilities for large personal funds transfers to channel funds into accounts around the globe;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(8) United States anti-money laundering efforts are impeded by outmoded and inadequate statutory provisions that make investigations, prosecutions, and forfeitures more difficult, particularly in cases in which money laundering involves foreign persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(9) the ability to mount effective counter-measures to international money launderers requires national, as well as bilateral and multilateral action, using tools specially designed for that effort; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering principles and recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.—The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2001 Amendment note set out under section 5301 of this title] are—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) to increase the strength of United States measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) to ensure that—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(A) banking transactions and financial relationships and the conduct of such transactions and relationships, do not contravene the purposes of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1829b], or chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91–508 (84 Stat. 1116) [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.], or facilitate the evasion of any such provision; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">“(B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be fulfilled, and such provisions of law are effectively and efficiently administered;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981 note) [see Short Title of 1986 Amendment note set out under section 981 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure], especially with respect to crimes by non-United States nationals and foreign financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that pose particular, identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title referred to as the ‘Secretary’) with broad discretion, subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative Procedure Act under title 5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., 701 et seq.], to take measures tailored to the particular money laundering problems presented by specific foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by affected financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that are of primary money laundering concern to the United States Government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the United States permits for adequate challenge consistent with providing due process rights;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(9) to clarify the terms of the safe harbor from civil liability for filing suspicious activity reports;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify that violations of such orders or any other requirement imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91–508 [12 U.S.C. 1951 et seq.] and subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, may result in criminal and civil penalties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the financial services industry are subject to appropriate requirements to report potential money laundering transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial institutions with relevant reporting requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(12) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to maintain the integrity of their employee population; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(13) to strengthen measures to prevent the use of the United States financial system for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials and to facilitate the repatriation of any stolen assets to the citizens of countries to whom such assets belong.”</p>

<p class="note-body">In the section, before clause (1), the words “have the responsibility to assure compliance with the requirements of this chapter” in 31:1054(a) are omitted as unnecessary because of section 321 of the revised title. The words “(except under section 5315 of this title and regulations prescribed under section 5315)” are added because 31:1141–1143 was not enacted as a part of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act that is restated in this subchapter. In clause (1), the words “duties and powers” are substituted for “responsibilities” for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words “bank supervisory agency, or other” are omitted as surplus. In clause (2), the words “by regulation” and “as he may deem” are omitted as surplus. The words “and regulations prescribed under this subchapter” are added because of the restatement. In clause (3), the word “prescribe” is substituted for “make” in 31:1055 for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107–56, title III, §371(a), (b), Oct. 26, 2001, 115 Stat. 336, 337, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">“(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) Effective enforcement of the currency reporting requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, and the regulations prescribed under such subchapter, has forced drug dealers and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid using traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) In their effort to avoid using traditional financial institutions, drug dealers and other criminals are forced to move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry where the currency can be smuggled out of the United States and placed in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black market.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form may now be the most common form of money laundering, and the movement of large sums of cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(4) The intentional transportation into or out of the United States of large amounts of currency or monetary instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory reporting provisions of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code,, [sic] is the equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the smuggling of goods.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(5) The arrest and prosecution of bulk cash smugglers are important parts of law enforcement's effort to stop the laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically low-level employees of large criminal organizations, and thus are easily replaced. Accordingly, only the confiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(6) The current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds. In particular, in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is a reporting offense, the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency. In contrast, if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.</p>
<p class="note-body">“(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.—The purposes of this section [enacting this section] are—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggling offense; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">“(3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.”</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings and Purpose.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Money laundering and related financial crimes frequently appear to be concentrated in particular geographic areas, financial systems, industry sectors, or financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) While the Secretary has the responsibility to act with regard to Federal offenses which are being committed in a particular locality or are directed at a single institution, because modern financial systems and institutions are interconnected to a degree which was not possible until recently, money laundering and other related financial crimes are likely to have local, State, national, and international effects wherever they are committed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Purpose and objective</cap-smallcap>.—It is the purpose of this section to provide a mechanism for designating any area where money laundering or a related financial crime appears to be occurring at a higher than average rate such that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a comprehensive approach to the problem of such crime in such area can be developed, in cooperation with State and local law enforcement agencies, which utilizes the authority of the Secretary to prevent such activity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such area can be targeted for law enforcement action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Element of National Strategy</cap-smallcap>.—The designation of certain areas as areas in which money laundering and related financial crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk shall be an element of the national strategy developed pursuant to section 5341(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Designation of Areas.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Designation by secretary</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary, after taking into consideration the factors specified in subsection (d), shall designate any geographical area, industry, sector, or institution in the United States in which money laundering and related financial crimes are extensive or present a substantial risk as a “high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area”.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Case-by-case determination in consultation with the attorney general</cap-smallcap>.—In addition to the factors specified in subsection (d), any designation of any area under paragraph (1) shall be made on the basis of a determination by the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, that the particular area, industry, sector, or institution is being victimized by, or is particularly vulnerable to, money laundering and related financial crimes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Specific initiatives</cap-smallcap>.—Any head of a department, bureau, or law enforcement agency, including any State or local prosecutor, involved in the detection, prevention, and suppression of money laundering and related financial crimes and any State or local official or prosecutor may submit—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a written request for the designation of any area as a high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a written request for funding under section 5351 for a specific prevention or enforcement initiative, or to determine the extent of financial criminal activity, in an area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Factors</cap-smallcap>.—In considering the designation of any area as a high-risk money laundering and related financial crimes area, the Secretary shall, to the extent appropriate and in consultation with the Attorney General, take into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The population of the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The number of bank and nonbank financial institution transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions located in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The number of stock or commodities transactions which originate in such area or involve institutions located in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whether the area is a key transportation hub with any international ports or airports or an extensive highway system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Whether the area is an international center for banking or commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The extent to which financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area are having a harmful impact in other areas of the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The number or nature of requests for information or analytical assistance which—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are made to the analytical component of the Department of the Treasury; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) originate from law enforcement or regulatory authorities located in such area or involve institutions or businesses located in such area or residents of such area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The volume or nature of suspicious activity reports originating in the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The volume or nature of currency transaction reports or reports of cross-border movements of currency or monetary instruments originating in, or transported through, the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Whether, and how often, the area has been the subject of a geographical targeting order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Observed changes in trends and patterns of money laundering activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Unusual patterns, anomalies, growth, or other changes in the volume or nature of core economic statistics or indicators.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Statistics or indicators of unusual or unexplained volumes of cash transactions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Unusual patterns, anomalies, or changes in the volume or nature of transactions conducted through financial institutions operating within or outside the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The extent to which State and local governments and State and local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to respond to the financial crime problem in the area and the degree to which the commitment of such resources reflects a determination by such government and agencies to address the problem aggressively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) The extent to which a significant increase in the allocation of Federal resources to combat financial crimes in such area is necessary to provide an adequate State and local response to financial crimes and financial crime-related activities in such area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Internet gambling is primarily funded through personal use of payment system instruments, credit cards, and wire transfers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 1999 recommended the passage of legislation to prohibit wire transfers to Internet gambling sites or the banks which represent such sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Internet gambling is a growing cause of debt collection problems for insured depository institutions and the consumer credit industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) New mechanisms for enforcing gambling laws on the Internet are necessary because traditional law enforcement mechanisms are often inadequate for enforcing gambling prohibitions or regulations on the Internet, especially where such gambling crosses State or national borders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Rule of Construction</cap-smallcap>.—No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as altering, limiting, or extending any Federal or State law or Tribal-State compact prohibiting, permitting, or regulating gambling within the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If a State disburses its own funds for program purposes in accordance with Federal law, Federal regulation, or Federal-State agreement, the State shall be entitled to interest from the time the State's funds are paid out to redeem checks or warrants, or make payments by other means, until the Federal funds are deposited to the State's bank account. The Secretary shall pay, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts as may be necessary for interest owed to a State under this subsection. Such interest shall be calculated, at a rate equal to the average of the bond equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the period for which interest is calculated, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If interest is paid under this subsection as a result of a State disbursing its own funds before receiving payment from a trust fund for which the Secretary of the Treasury is the trustee, such interest shall be charged against such trust fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The budget submitted by the President under section 1105 of this title for a fiscal year shall include a statement specifying, for the most recently completed fiscal year, amounts of interest accrued to the Federal Government under subsection (c) and amounts of interest paid to States under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) If a State receives refunds of funds disbursed by the State under a Federal program, the State shall return those refunds to the Federal executive agency administering the program or apply those refunds to reduce the amount of funds owed by the Federal Government to the State under such program. Interest earned on such refunds shall be considered when setting overall interest obligations between the State and the Federal Government as required by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If the Federal Government makes a payment to a recipient under a Federal program, and a portion of the payment is an amount which the Federal Government is paying to such recipient on behalf of a State, such amount shall be considered to be a transfer of funds between the Federal Government and the State for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A State may not be required by a law or regulation of the United States to deposit funds received by it in a separate bank account. However, a State shall account for funds made available to the State as United States Government funds in the accounts of the State. The head of the State agency concerned shall make periodic authenticated reports to the head of the appropriate Federal executive agency on the status and the application of the funds, the liabilities and obligations on hand, and other information required by the head of the executive agency. Records related to the funds received by the State shall be made available to the head of the executive agency, the Inspector General of the executive agency, and the Comptroller General for necessary audits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The Secretary shall prescribe methods for the payment of interest under this section between the Federal Government and the States, including provisions for offsetting amounts owed by the respective parties. Such methods of payment shall require payment of interest on an annual basis and shall provide for comparable treatment in manner, technique, and timing for both the States and the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Consistent with Federal program purposes and regulations of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of a Federal executive agency carrying out a program shall execute grant awards to States on a timely basis to assure the availability of funds to accomplish transfers in compliance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The economic and social development of the United States and the achievement of satisfactory levels of living depend on the sound and orderly development of urban and rural areas. When urbanization proceeds rapidly, the sound and orderly development of urban communities depends to a large degree on the social and economic health and the sound development of smaller communities and rural areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The President shall prescribe regulations governing the formulation, evaluation, and review of United States Government programs and projects having a significant impact on area and community development (including programs and projects providing assistance to States and localities) to serve most effectively the basic objectives of subsection (a) of this section. The regulations shall provide for the consideration of concurrently achieving the following specific objectives and, to the extent authorized by law, reasoned choices shall be made between the objectives when they conflict:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriate land uses for housing, commercial, industrial, governmental, institutional, and other purposes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) concern for high standards of design.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

State and local government objectives and the objectives of regional organizations shall be considered within a framework of national public objectives expressed in laws of the United States. Available projections of future conditions in the United States and needs of regions, States, and localities shall be considered in plan formulation, evaluation, and review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) To the maximum extent possible and consistent with national objectives, assistance for development purposes shall be consistent with and further the objectives of State, regional, and local comprehensive planning.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) To the maximum extent practicable, each executive agency carrying out a development assistance program shall consult with and seek advice from all other significantly affected executive agencies in an effort to ensure completely coordinated programs. To the extent possible, systematic planning required by individual United States Government programs (such as highway construction, urban renewal, and open space) shall be coordinated with and, to the extent authorized by law, made part of comprehensive local and areawide development planning.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) When a law of the United States provides that both a special-purpose unit of local government and a unit of general local government are eligible to receive a loan or grant, the head of an executive agency shall make the loan or grant to the unit of general local government instead of the special-purpose unit of local government in the absence of substantial reasons to the contrary.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12372, July 14, 1982, 47 F.R. 30959, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 12416, Apr. 8, 1983, 48 F.R. 15587, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including Section 401(a) of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4231(a)) [31 U.S.C. 6506(a) and (b)], Section 204 of the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 (42. U.S.C. 3334) and Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, and in order to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on State and local processes for the State and local government coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. Federal agencies shall provide opportunities for consultation by elected officials of those State and local governments that would provide the non-Federal funds for, or that would be directly affected by, proposed Federal financial assistance or direct Federal development.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. To the extent the States, in consultation with local general purpose governments, and local special purpose governments they consider appropriate, develop their own processes or refine existing processes for State and local elected officials to review and coordinate proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development, the Federal agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Utilize the State process to determine official views of State and local elected officials.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Communicate with State and local elected officials as early in the program planning cycle as is reasonably feasible to explain specific plans and actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Make efforts to accommodate State and local elected officials’ concerns with proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development that are communicated through the designated State process. For those cases where the concerns cannot be accommodated, Federal officials shall explain the bases for their decision in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Allow the States to simplify and consolidate existing Federally required State plan submissions. Where State planning and budgeting systems are sufficient and where permitted by law, the substitution of State plans for Federally required State plans shall be encouraged by the agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Seek the coordination of views of affected State and local elected officials in one State with those of another State when proposed Federal financial assistance or direct Federal development has an impact on interstate metropolitan urban centers or other interstate areas. Existing interstate mechanisms that are redesignated as part of the State process may be used for this purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Support State and local governments by discouraging the reauthorization or creation of any planning organization which is Federally-funded, which has a Federally-prescribed membership, which is established for a limited purpose, and which is not adequately representative of, or accountable to, State or local elected officials.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) The State process referred to in Section 2 shall include those where States delegate, in specific instances, to local elected officials the review, coordination, and communication with Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) At the discretion of the State and local elected officials, the State process may exclude certain Federal programs from review and comment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall maintain a list of official State entities designated by the States to review and coordinate proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development. The Office of Management and Budget shall disseminate such lists to the Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) Agencies shall propose rules and regulations governing the formulation, evaluation, and review of proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development pursuant to this Order, to be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The rules and regulations which result from the process indicated in Section 5(a) above shall replace any current rules and regulations and become effective September 30, 1983.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations, if any, as he deems appropriate for the effective implementation and administration of this Order and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 [31 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.]. The Director is also authorized to exercise the authority vested in the President by Section 401(a) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4231(a)) [31 U.S.C. 6506(a) and (b)] in a manner consistent with this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. The Memorandum of November 8, 1968, is terminated (33 <em>Fed. Reg</em>. 16487, November 13, 1968). The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall revoke OMB Circular A–95, which was issued pursuant to that Memorandum. However, Federal agencies shall continue to comply with the rules and regulations issued pursuant to that Memorandum, including those issued by the Office of Management and Budget, until new rules and regulations have been issued in accord with this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall report to the President by September 30, 1984 on Federal agency compliance with this Order. The views of State and local elected officials on their experiences with these policies, along with any suggestions for improvement, will be included in the Director's report.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall make payments only for the 5 fiscal years after the fiscal year in which the interest in land is acquired. Under guidelines the Secretary prescribes, the unit of general local government receiving the payment from the Secretary shall distribute payments proportionally to units and school districts that lost real property taxes because of the acquisition of the interest. A unit receiving a distribution may use a payment for any governmental purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each yearly payment by the Secretary under this section is equal to one percent of the fair market value of the interest in land on the date the Government acquires the interest. However, a payment may not be more than the amount of real property taxes levied on the property during the last fiscal year before the fiscal year in which the interest is acquired. A decision on fair market value under this section may not include an increase in the value of an interest because the land is rezoned when the rezoning causes the increase after the date of enactment of a law authorizing the acquisition of an interest under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments may be made to units of general local government when subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not carry out the purpose of subsections (a) and (b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this chapter do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal official.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subsection (a) shall apply to a non-Federal entity which undergoes an audit in accordance with this chapter even though it is not required by section 7502(a) to have such an audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A Federal agency that provides Federal awards and conducts or arranges for audits of non-Federal entities receiving such awards that are in addition to the audits of non-Federal entities conducted pursuant to this chapter shall, consistent with other applicable law, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits. Any such additional audits shall be coordinated with the Federal agency determined under criteria issued under section 7504 to preclude duplication of the audits conducted pursuant to this chapter or other additional audits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Upon request by a Federal agency or the Comptroller General, any independent auditor conducting an audit pursuant to this chapter shall make the auditor's working papers available to the Federal agency or the Comptroller General as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation standards for the safeguarding and use of obligations that are government securities described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 3(a)(42) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such regulations shall apply only to a depository institution that is not a government securities broker or a government securities dealer and that holds such obligations as fiduciary, custodian, or otherwise for the account of a customer and not for its own account. Such regulations shall provide for the adequate segregation of obligations so held, including obligations which are purchased or sold subject to resale or repurchase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Violation of a regulation prescribed under subsection (a) shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under section 5239(a) or (b) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 93(a) or (b)), section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 5(d)(2) or 5(d)(3) <sup><a href="#9110_1_target" name="9110_1">1</a></sup> of the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933, section 407(e) or 407(f) <sup><a href="#9110_1_target" name="9110_1">1</a></sup> of the National Housing Act, or section 206(e) or 206(f) of the Federal Credit Union Act. Such an order may be issued with respect to a depository institution by its appropriate regulatory agency and with respect to a federally insured credit union by the National Credit Union Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect in any way the powers of such agencies under any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary shall, prior to adopting regulations under this section, determine with respect to each appropriate regulatory agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board, whether its rules and standards adequately meet the purposes of regulations to be promulgated under this section, and if the Secretary so determines, shall exempt any depository institution subject to such rules or standards from the regulations promulgated under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) As used in this subsection—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) “depository institution” has the meaning stated in clauses (i) through (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act and also includes a foreign bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank, and a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in the International Banking Act of 1978).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) “government securities broker” has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(43) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) “government securities dealer” has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If a person is required under a law of the United States to give a surety bond, the person may give an eligible obligation as security instead of a surety bond. The obligation shall—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be given to the official having authority to approve the surety bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, have a market value that is equal to or greater than the amount of the required surety bond; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authorize the official receiving the obligation to collect or sell the obligation if the person defaults on a required condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An official receiving an eligible obligation under subsection (a) of this section may deposit it with—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a Federal reserve bank; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a depositary designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, bank, or depositary shall issue a receipt that describes the obligation deposited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Using an eligible obligation instead of a surety bond for security is the same as using—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a personal or corporate surety bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a certified check;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a bank draft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a post office money order; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) cash.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When security is no longer required, an eligible obligation given instead of a surety bond shall be returned to the person giving the obligation. If a person, supplying labor or material to a contractor defaulting under sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40, files with the United States Government the application and affidavit provided under section 3133(a) of title 40, the Government—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may return to the contractor the eligible obligation given as security (or proceeds of the eligible obligation given) under sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40 only after the 90-day period for bringing a civil action under section 3133(b) of title 40; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a civil action is brought in the 90-day period, shall hold the eligible obligation or the proceeds subject to the order of the court having jurisdiction of the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not affect the—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) priority of a claim of the Government against an eligible obligation given under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) right or remedy of the Government for default on an obligation provided under—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sections 3131 and 3133 of title 40; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authority of a court over an eligible obligation given as security in a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) authority of an official of the Government authorized by another law to receive an eligible obligation as security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) To avoid frequent substitution of eligible obligations, the Secretary may prescribe regulations limiting the effect of this section to an eligible obligation maturing more than one year after the date the obligation is given as security.</p>

In preparing and submitting the performance plan under section 1105(a)(29),<sup><a href="#9703_2_target" name="9703_2">2</a></sup> the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall review and may approve any proposed waivers. A waiver shall take effect at the beginning of the fiscal year for which the waiver is approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any such proposal under subsection (a) shall describe the anticipated effects on performance resulting from greater managerial or organizational flexibility, discretion, and authority, and shall quantify the expected improvements in performance resulting from any waiver. The expected improvements shall be compared to current actual performance, and to the projected level of performance that would be achieved independent of any waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any proposal waiving limitations on compensation or remuneration shall precisely express the monetary change in compensation or remuneration amounts, such as bonuses or awards, that shall result from meeting, exceeding, or failing to meet performance goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any proposed waiver of procedural requirements or controls imposed by an agency (other than the proposing agency or the Office of Management and Budget) may not be included in a performance plan unless it is endorsed by the agency that established the requirement, and the endorsement included in the proposing agency's performance plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A waiver shall be in effect for one or two years as specified by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in approving the waiver. A waiver may be renewed for a subsequent year. After a waiver has been in effect for three consecutive years, the performance plan prepared under section 1115 may propose that a waiver, other than a waiver of limitations on compensation or remuneration, be made permanent.</p>
