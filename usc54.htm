<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words "Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Park Service" are substituted for "service thus established" to reflect the transfer of functions of other officers, employees, and agencies of the Department of the Interior to the Secretary by sections 1 and 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1950 (5 U.S.C. App.) while keeping the responsibility for promoting and regulating the use of the National Park System with the Director of the National Park Service.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(D), the words "this division" are substituted for "this Act" for clarity. The purpose of the Act of August 18, 1970 (known as the National Park System General Authorities Act) (Public Law 91–383, 84 Stat. 825), was to update and clarify the law with respect to the various units of the National Park System by enlarging the application of existing general statutes so that they apply uniformly to the administration of the various types of parklands within the national park system. See H. Rept. 91–1265 (91st Cong., 2d Sess.). However, section 2(b) of that Act, rather than being enacted as a new provision of law, amended section 2 of the Act of August 8, 1953 (ch. 384, 67 Stat. 496), and would not be included in the reference to "this Act" in section 1 of the Act of August 18, 1970. The revised subsection translates the reference to "this Act" to carry out the intent of the Act of August 18, 1970.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Leasehold Surrender Interest in Capital Improvements</cap-smallcap>.—A concessioner that constructs a capital improvement on land owned by the United States within a System unit pursuant to a concession contract shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement subject to the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.—A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in each capital improvement constructed by a concessioner under a concession contract, consisting solely of a right to compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Pledge as security</cap-smallcap>.—A leasehold surrender interest may be pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the acquisition of a concession contract when approved by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Transfer and relinquishment or waiver of interest</cap-smallcap>.—A leasehold surrender interest shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concession contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Limit on extinguishing or taking interest</cap-smallcap>.—A leasehold surrender interest shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other termination of a concession contract and may not be taken for public use except on payment of just compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Value of interest</cap-smallcap>.—The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), increased (or decreased) by the same percentage increase (or decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Value of interest in certain new concession contracts.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>How value is determined</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary may provide, in any new concession contract that the Secretary estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be based on—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of years as the time period associated with the straight line depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and regulations in effect on November 12, 1998; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an alternative formula that is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>When alternative formula may be used</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary may use an alternative formula under subparagraph (A)(ii) only if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in the particular concession contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that the alternative formula is, compared to the standard method of determining value provided for in paragraph (5), necessary to provide a fair return to the Federal Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in response to a solicitation that includes the alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as described in paragraph (5).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Increase in value of interest</cap-smallcap>.—Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a concession contract, makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of the additional capital improvement shall be added to the then-current value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Special Rule for Possessory Interest Existing Before November </cap-smallcap>13, 1998.—</p>

Where that possessory interest is not described in the existing concession contract, compensation of possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws in effect on November 12, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Existing concessioner awarded a new contract</cap-smallcap>.—A concessioner awarded a new concession contract to replace an existing concession contract after November 13, 1998, instead of directly receiving the possessory interest compensation, shall have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new concession contract and shall carry over as the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous concession contract. In the event of a dispute between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of the possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>New concessioner awarded a contract</cap-smallcap>.—A new concessioner awarded a concession contract and required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the prior improvements.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>De novo review of value determination</cap-smallcap>.—If the Secretary, or either party to a value determination proceeding conducted under a Service concession contract issued before November 13, 1998, considers that the value determination decision issued pursuant to the proceeding misinterprets or misapplies relevant contractual requirements or their underlying legal authority, the Secretary or either party may seek, within 180 days after the date of the decision, de novo review of the value determination decision by the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims may make an order affirming, vacating, modifying or correcting the determination decision.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Transition to Successor Concessioner</cap-smallcap>.—On expiration or termination of a concession contract entered into after November 13, 1998, a concessioner shall be entitled under the terms of the concession contract to receive from the United States or a successor concessioner the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement as of the date of the expiration or termination. A successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement under the terms of a new concession contract and the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement (instead of construction cost) shall be the amount of money the new concessioner is required to pay the prior concessioner for its leasehold surrender interest under the terms of the prior concession contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Title to Improvements</cap-smallcap>.—Title to any capital improvement constructed by a concessioner on land owned by the United States in a System unit shall be vested in the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The 2d amendment to the Constitution provides that "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed".</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Section 2.4(a)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that "except as otherwise provided in this section and parts 7 (special regulations) and 13 (Alaska regulations), the following are prohibited: (i) Possessing a weapon, trap or net (ii) Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) Using a weapon, trap or net".</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent individuals complying with Federal and State laws from exercising the 2d amendment rights of the individuals while at System units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The existence of different laws relating to the transportation and possession of firearms at different System units entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at System units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Although the Bush administration issued new regulations relating to the 2d amendment rights of law-abiding citizens in System units that went into effect on January 9, 2009—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction with respect to the implementation and enforcement of the new regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the new regulations—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are under review by the Obama administration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may be altered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again override the 2d amendment rights of law-abiding citizens on 83,600,000 acres of System land.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal laws should make it clear that the 2d amendment rights of an individual at a System unit should not be infringed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Protection of Right of Individuals To Bear Arms in System Units</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary shall not promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from possessing a firearm, including an assembled or functional firearm, in any System unit if—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the law of the State in which the System unit is located.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">A 21st Century Strategy for America's Great Outdoors</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 16, 2010, 75 F.R. 20767, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior[,] the Secretary of Agriculture[,] the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency[, and] the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality</p>
<p class="note-body">Americans are blessed with a vast and varied natural heritage. From mountains to deserts and from sea to shining sea, America's great outdoors have shaped the rugged independence and sense of community that define the American spirit. Our working landscapes, cultural sites, parks, coasts, wild lands, rivers, and streams are gifts that we have inherited from previous generations. They are the places that offer us refuge from daily demands, renew our spirits, and enhance our fondest memories, whether they are fishing with a grandchild in a favorite spot, hiking a trail with a friend, or enjoying a family picnic in a neighborhood park. They also are our farms, ranches, and forests—the working lands that have fed and sustained us for generations. Americans take pride in these places, and share a responsibility to preserve them for our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, however, we are losing touch with too many of the places and proud traditions that have helped to make America special. Farms, ranches, forests, and other valuable natural resources are disappearing at an alarming rate. Families are spending less time together enjoying their natural surroundings. Despite our conservation efforts, too many of our fields are becoming fragmented, too many of our rivers and streams are becoming polluted, and we are losing our connection to the parks, wild places, and open spaces we grew up with and cherish. Children, especially, are spending less time outside running and playing, fishing and hunting, and connecting to the outdoors just down the street or outside of town.</p>
<p class="note-body">Across America, communities are uniting to protect the places they love, and developing new approaches to saving and enjoying the outdoors. They are bringing together farmers and ranchers, land trusts, recreation and conservation groups, sportsmen, community park groups, governments and industry, and people from all over the country to develop new partnerships and innovative programs to protect and restore our outdoors legacy. However, these efforts are often scattered and sometimes insufficient. The Federal Government, the Nation's largest land manager, has a responsibility to engage with these partners to help develop a conservation agenda worthy of the 21st Century. We must look to the private sector and nonprofit organizations, as well as towns, cities, and States, and the people who live and work in them, to identify the places that mean the most to Americans, and leverage the support of the Federal Government to help these community-driven efforts to succeed. Through these partnerships, we will work to connect these outdoor spaces to each other, and to reconnect Americans to them.</p>
<p class="note-body">For these reasons, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Establishment.</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) There is established the America's Great Outdoors Initiative (Initiative), to be led by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and implemented in coordination with the agencies listed in section 2(b) of this memorandum. The Initiative may include the heads of other executive branch departments, agencies, and offices (agencies) as the President may, from time to time, designate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The goals of the Initiative shall be to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Reconnect Americans, especially children, to America's rivers and waterways, landscapes of national significance, ranches, farms and forests, great parks, and coasts and beaches by exploring a variety of efforts, including:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) promoting community-based recreation and conservation, including local parks, greenways, beaches, and waterways;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) advancing job and volunteer opportunities related to conservation and outdoor recreation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) supporting existing programs and projects that educate and engage Americans in our history, culture, and natural bounty.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) Build upon State, local, private, and tribal priorities for the conservation of land, water, wildlife, historic, and cultural resources, creating corridors and connectivity across these outdoor spaces, and for enhancing neighborhood parks; and determine how the Federal Government can best advance those priorities through public private partnerships and locally supported conservation strategies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) Use science-based management practices to restore and protect our lands and waters for future generations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Functions</i>. The functions of the Initiative shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <i>Outreach</i>. The Initiative shall conduct listening and learning sessions around the country where land and waters are being conserved and community parks are being established in innovative ways. These sessions should engage the full range of interested groups, including tribal leaders, farmers and ranchers, sportsmen, community park groups, foresters, youth groups, businesspeople, educators, State and local governments, and recreation and conservation groups. Special attention should be given to bringing young Americans into the conversation. These listening sessions will inform the reports required in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <i>Interagency Coordination</i>. The following agencies shall work with the Initiative to identify existing resources and align policies and programs to achieve its goals:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the Department of Defense;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the Department of Commerce;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) the Department of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) the Department of Labor;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) the Department of Transportation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vii) the Department of Education; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(viii) the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <i>Reports</i>. The Initiative shall submit, through the Chair of the CEQ, the following reports to the President:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Report on America's Great Outdoors. By November 15, 2010, the Initiative shall submit a report that includes the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) a review of successful and promising nonfederal conservation approaches;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) an analysis of existing Federal resources and programs that could be used to complement those approaches;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) proposed strategies and activities to achieve the goals of the Initiative; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(D) an action plan to meet the goals of the Initiative.</p>
<p class="note-body">The report should reflect the constraints in resources available in, and be consistent with, the Federal budget. It should recommend efficient and effective use of existing resources, as well as opportunities to leverage nonfederal public and private resources and nontraditional conservation programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) Annual reports. By September 30, 2011, and September 30, 2012, the Initiative shall submit reports on its progress in implementing the action plan developed pursuant to subsection (c)(i)(D) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>General Provisions.</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of any necessary appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This memorandum does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and provide information to the Initiative, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Initiative. Each executive department and agency shall bear its own expenses of participating in the Initiative.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Chair of the CEQ is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Criteria for designation of areas</i>. Areas shall, in accordance with Section 1(b) and Section 2(b) of this Order and to the extent permitted by the Act, be designated as areas at which recreation user fees shall be charged if the following conditions are found to exist concurrently:</p>

Each such official shall also specify which designated areas shall be excluded from the coverage of the annual fee described in Section 2(a)(1) of the Act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–5(a)(i)] and which, as a result of that exclusion will be subject to the fee described in Section 2(a)(iii) of the Act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–5(a)(iii)]. The range of recreation user fees to be charged and the criteria for their selection shall be established under the procedures prescribed by Section 6 of this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of the Interior shall prescribe the procedures for the production, distribution, and sale of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Sticker, which shall be issued to those individuals who elect to pay the annual fees.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>Coordination</i>. (a) The Secretary of the Interior shall after consultation with the heads of other affected departments and agencies, adopt such coordination measures as are necessary to carry out the purposes of Sections 2(a) and 4(a) of the Act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–5(a), 460l–7(a)] and the provisions of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b)(1) In order that the purposes of the Act and of this Order may be effectuated without delay, the Secretary of the Interior shall, subject to the limitations imposed by the Act and without regard to the other provisions of this section, forthwith issue a schedule of recreation user fees and criteria to be used in determining which such fees shall be charged with respect to each of the designated areas.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Subject to the limitations imposed by the Act and subject to the provisions of subsections (a), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary of the Interior may, from time to time, amend or replace the schedule of fees and the criteria prescribed by him pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Subject to the limits set forth in the Act, the measures which the Secretary of the Interior may adopt pursuant to subsection (a) of this section may include, but are not limited to, the following—</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Initial preparation and coordination of the comprehensive statement of estimated requirements during the ensuing fiscal year for appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, as required by Section 4(a) of the act [former 16 U.S.C. 460l–7(a)].</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) Except with respect to the schedule of fees and the criteria prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section, measures and regulations adopted by the Secretary pursuant to this Order shall not become effective until 30 days after they are presented for the consideration of the other officials described in Section 1(b). Any such official who does not concur in any such measure or regulation may, within that 30-day period, refer the matter to the Recreation Advisory Council established under Executive Order No. 11017 [superseded by Ex. Ord. No. 11278, which in turn was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 11472, which is set out as a note under section 4321 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] for resolution. If a proposed measure is referred to the Council for resolution, it shall not become effective until approved by the Council. With the approval of all other officials described in Section 1(b) of this Order, the provisions of this subsection may be waived with respect to any specific measure or regulation adopted by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to this order so that any such measure or regulation may be made effective before the expiration of the 30-day waiting period prescribed by the first sentence of this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <i>Review of contracts</i>.

Special attention shall be given to any provision in any such contract or other arrangement which prohibits or discourages in any way such non-Federal public entity from charging recreation user fees. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, each such restrictive provision shall be the subject of renegotiation designed to accomplish a modification thereof that will permit the charging of recreation user fees.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <i>Regulations</i>. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out his functions under this Order.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority of Secretary To Make Payments</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary may provide financial assistance to the States from amounts available for State purposes. Payments may be made to the States by the Secretary as provided in this section, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate and in the public interest to carry out the purposes of this chapter, for outdoor recreation:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Planning.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Acquisition of land, water, or interests in land or water.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Development.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Apportionment Among States</cap-smallcap>.—Amounts appropriated and available for State purposes for each fiscal year shall be apportioned among the States by the Secretary, whose determination shall be final, in accordance with the following formula:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Forty percent of the 1st $225,000,000; 30 percent of the next $275,000,000; and 20 percent of all additional appropriations shall be apportioned equally among the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) At any time, the remaining appropriation shall be apportioned on the basis of need to individual States by the Secretary in such amounts as in the Secretary's judgment will best accomplish the purposes of this chapter. The determination of need shall include consideration of—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the proportion that the population of each State bears to the total population of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the use of outdoor recreation resources of each State by persons from outside the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Federal resources and programs in each State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The total allocation to a State under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to all of the States in any one year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary shall notify each State of its apportionments. The amounts shall be available for payment to the State for planning, acquisition, or development projects as prescribed. Any amount of any apportionment that has not been paid or obligated by the Secretary during the fiscal year in which the notification is given and for 2 fiscal years thereafter shall be reapportioned by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2) without regard to the 10 percent limitation to an individual State specified in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands shall be deemed to be one State, and shall receive shares of the apportionment in proportion to their populations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Matching Requirements</cap-smallcap>.—Payments to any State shall cover not more than 50 percent of the cost of planning, acquisition, or development projects that are undertaken by the State. The remaining share of the cost shall be borne by the State in a manner and with funds or services as shall be satisfactory to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Comprehensive State Plan.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Required for consideration of financial assistance</cap-smallcap>.—A comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall be required prior to the consideration by the Secretary of financial assistance for acquisition or development projects. The plan shall be adequate if, in the judgment of the Secretary, it encompasses and will promote the purposes of this chapter. No plan shall be approved unless the chief executive official of the State certifies that ample opportunity for public participation in plan development and revision has been accorded. The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with others, criteria for public participation, which criteria shall constitute the basis for the certification by the chief executive official. The plan shall contain—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the name of the State agency that will have authority to represent and act for the State in dealing with the Secretary for purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an evaluation of the demand for and supply of outdoor recreation resources and facilities in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a program for the implementation of the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) other necessary information, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Factors to be considered</cap-smallcap>.—The plan shall take into account relevant Federal resources and programs and shall be correlated so far as practicable with other State, regional, and local plans. Where there exists or is in preparation for any particular State a comprehensive plan financed in part with funds supplied by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, any statewide outdoor recreation plan prepared for purposes of this part shall be based on the same population, growth, and other pertinent factors as are used in formulating plans financed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Provision of assistance when plan not otherwise available or to maintain plan</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary may provide financial assistance to any State for projects for the preparation of a comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan when the plan is not otherwise available or for the maintenance of the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Wetlands</cap-smallcap>.—A comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall specifically address wetlands within the State as an important outdoor recreation resource as a prerequisite to approval, except that a revised comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall not be required by the Secretary, if a State submits, and the Secretary, acting through the Director, approves, as a part of and as an addendum to the existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan, a wetlands priority plan developed in consultation with the State agency with responsibility for fish and wildlife resources and consistent with the national wetlands priority conservation plan developed under section 301 of the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3921) or, if the national plan has not been completed, consistent with the provisions of that section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Projects for Land and Water Acquisition and Development of Basic Outdoor Recreation Facilities.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.—In addition to assistance for planning projects, the Secretary may provide financial assistance to any State for the types of projects described in paragraphs (2) and (3), or combinations of those projects, if the projects are in accordance with the State comprehensive plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Acquisition of land or water.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.—Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for the acquisition of land, water, or an interest in land or water, or a wetland area or an interest in a wetland area, as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan (other than land, water, or an interest in land or water acquired from the United States for less than fair market value), but not including incidental costs relating to acquisition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Retention of right of use and occupancy</cap-smallcap>.—When a State provides that the owner of a single-family residence may, at the owner's option, elect to retain a right of use and occupancy for not less than 6 months after the date of acquisition of the residence and the owner elects to retain such a right—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits under sections 203 to 206 of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4623 to 4626); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for the purposes of those sections the owner shall not be deemed to be a displaced person as defined in section 101 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4601).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Development of basic outdoor recreation facilities</cap-smallcap>.—Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a project for development of basic outdoor recreation facilities to serve the general public, including the development of Federal land under lease to States for terms of 25 years or more. No assistance shall be available under this chapter to enclose or shelter a facility normally used for an outdoor recreation activity, but the Secretary may permit local funding, not to exceed 10 percent of the total amount allocated to a State in any one year, to be used for construction of a sheltered facility for a swimming pool or ice skating rink in an area where the Secretary determines that the construction is justified by the severity of climatic conditions and the increased public use made possible by the construction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Payments.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for making payments</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary may make a payment to a State only for a planning, acquisition, or development project that is approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall not make a payment for or on account of any project with respect to which financial assistance has been given or promised under any other Federal program or activity, and no financial assistance shall be given under any other Federal program or activity for or on account of any project with respect to which the assistance has been given or promised under this chapter. The Secretary may make payments from time to time in keeping with the rate of progress toward the satisfactory completion of a project. The approval of all projects and all payments, or any commitments relating thereto, shall be withheld until the Secretary receives appropriate written assurance from the State that the State has the ability and intention to finance its share of the cost of all of the projects, and to operate and maintain by acceptable standards, at State expense, the properties or facilities acquired or developed for public outdoor recreation use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Payment recipients</cap-smallcap>.—Payments for all projects shall be made by the Secretary to the chief executive official of the State or to a State official or agency designated by the chief executive official or by State law having authority and responsibility to accept and to administer funds paid under this section for approved projects. If consistent with an approved project, funds may be transferred by the State to a political subdivision or other appropriate public agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Conversion to other than public outdoor recreation use</cap-smallcap>.—No property acquired or developed with assistance under this section shall, without the approval of the Secretary, be converted to other than public outdoor recreation use. The Secretary shall approve a conversion only if the Secretary finds it to be in accordance with the then-existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan and only on such conditions as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the substitution of other recreation properties of at least equal fair market value and of reasonably equivalent usefulness and location. Wetland areas and interests therein as identified in the wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan and proposed to be acquired as suitable replacement property within the same State that is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary, acting through the Director, shall be deemed to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness with the property proposed for conversion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Reports and accounting procedures</cap-smallcap>.—No payment shall be made to any State until the State has agreed to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide such reports to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to perform the Secretary's duties under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount and the disposition by the recipient of the proceeds of the assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection with which the assistance is given or used; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount and nature of that portion of the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such other records as will facilitate an effective audit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Access to Records</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary, and the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any records of the recipient that are pertinent to assistance received under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition of Discrimination</cap-smallcap>.—With respect to property acquired or developed with assistance from the Fund, discrimination on the basis of residence, including preferential reservation or membership systems, is prohibited except to the extent that reasonable differences in admission and other fees may be maintained on the basis of residence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Coordination With Federal Agencies</cap-smallcap>.—To ensure consistency in policies and actions under this chapter with other related Federal programs and activities and to ensure coordination of the planning, acquisition, and development assistance to States under this section with other related Federal programs and activities—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the President may issue such regulations with respect thereto as the President considers desirable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the assistance may be provided only in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Capital Improvement and Other Projects To Reduce Crime.—</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increase lighting within or adjacent to public parks and recreation areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide emergency telephone lines to contact law enforcement or security personnel in areas within or adjacent to public parks and recreation areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increase security personnel within or adjacent to public parks and recreation areas; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility</cap-smallcap>.—In addition to the requirements for project approval imposed by this section, eligibility for assistance under this subsection shall depend on a showing of need.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Matching Grants</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary may provide 70 percent matching rehabilitation grants and innovation grants directly to eligible general purpose local governments on the Secretary's approval of applications for the grants by the chief executive officials of those governments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Special Considerations</cap-smallcap>.—An innovation grant should be closely tied to goals, priorities, and implementation strategies expressed in local park and recreation recovery action programs, with particular regard to the special considerations listed in section 200504(c)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Transfer</cap-smallcap>.—If consistent with an approved application, a grant recipient may transfer a rehabilitation grant or innovation grant in whole or in part to an independent special purpose local government, private nonprofit agency, or county or regional park authority if the assisted recreation area or facility owned or managed by the transferree <sup><a href="#200503_1_target" name="200503_1">1</a></sup> offers recreation opportunities to the general population within the jurisdictional boundaries of the grant recipient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Payments</cap-smallcap>.—Payments may be made only for a rehabilitation project or innovation project that has been approved by the Secretary.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Evidence of Local Commitment to Ongoing Programs</cap-smallcap>.—As a requirement for project approval, local governments applying for assistance under this chapter shall submit to the Secretary evidence of their commitments to ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation, and maintenance programs for their park and recreation systems. These commitments will be expressed in local park and recreation recovery action programs that maximize coordination of all community resources, including other federally supported urban development and recreation programs. During an initial interim period to be established by regulations under this chapter, this requirement may be satisfied by local government submissions of preliminary action programs that briefly define objectives, priorities, and implementation strategies for overall system recovery and maintenance and commit the applicant to a scheduled program development process. Following this interim period, all local applicants shall submit to the Secretary, as a condition of eligibility, a 5-year action program for park and recreation recovery that satisfactorily demonstrates—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) systematic identification of recovery objectives, priorities, and implementation strategies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adequate planning for rehabilitation of specific recreation areas and facilities, including projections of the cost of proposed projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the capacity and commitment to ensure that facilities provided or improved under this chapter shall continue to be adequately maintained, protected, staffed, and supervised;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the intention to maintain total local public outlays for park and recreation purposes at levels at least equal to those in the year preceding that in which grant assistance is sought except in any case where a reduction in park and recreation outlays is proportionate to a reduction in overall spending by the applicant; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Continuing Planning Process</cap-smallcap>.—Where appropriate, the Secretary may encourage local governments to meet action program requirements through a continuing planning process that includes periodic improvements and updates in action program submissions to eliminate identified gaps in program information and policy development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Special Considerations</cap-smallcap>.—Action programs shall address, but are not limited to—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rehabilitation of existing recreational areas and facilities, including—</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) local commitments to innovative and cost-effective programs and projects at the neighborhood level to augment recovery of park and recreation systems, including—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) recycling of abandoned schools and other public buildings for recreational purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) multiple use of operating educational and other public buildings, purchase of recreation services on a contractual basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) use of mobile facilities and recreational, cultural, and educational programs or other innovative approaches to improving access for neighborhood residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) integration of recovery program with federally assisted projects to maximize recreational opportunities through conversion of abandoned railroad and highway rights of way, waterfront, and other redevelopment efforts and such other federally assisted projects as may be appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) conversion of recreation use of street space, derelict land, and other public land not now designated for neighborhood recreational use; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) use of various forms of compensated and uncompensated land regulation, tax inducements, or other means to encourage the private sector to provide neighborhood park and recreation facilities and programs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Publication in Federal Register</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary shall establish and publish in the Federal Register requirements for preparation, submission, and updating of local park and recreation recovery action programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Eligibility for At-Risk Youth Recreation Grants</cap-smallcap>.—To be eligible to receive at-risk youth recreation grants a local government shall amend its 5-year action program to incorporate the goal of reducing crime and juvenile delinquency and to provide a description of the implementation strategies to achieve this goal. The plan shall also address how the local government is coordinating its recreation programs with crime prevention efforts of law enforcement, juvenile corrections, and youth social service agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Matching Recovery Action Program Grants</cap-smallcap>.—The Secretary may provide up to 50 percent matching recovery action program grants to eligible local governments for program development and planning specifically to meet the objectives of this chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. The Federal Government shall provide leadership in preserving, restoring and maintaining the historic and cultural environment of the Nation. Agencies of the executive branch of the Government (hereinafter referred to as "Federal agencies") shall (1) administer the cultural properties under their control in a spirit of stewardship and trusteeship for future generations, (2) initiate measures necessary to direct their policies, plans and programs in such a way that federally owned sites, structures, and objects of historical, architectural or archaeological significance are preserved, restored and maintained for the inspiration and benefit of the people, and (3), in consultation with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ([former] 16 U.S.C. 470i [see 54 U.S.C. 304101]), institute procedures to assure that Federal plans and programs contribute to the preservation and enhancement of non-federally owned sites, structures and objects of historical, architectural or archaeological significance.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Responsibilities of Federal agencies</i>. Consonant with the provisions of the acts cited in the first paragraph of this order, the heads of Federal agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) no later than July 1, 1973, with the advice of the Secretary of the Interior, and in cooperation with the liaison officer for historic preservation for the State or territory involved, locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all sites, buildings, districts, and objects under their jurisdiction or control that appear to qualify for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) exercise caution during the interim period until inventories and evaluations required by subsection (a) are completed to assure that any federally owned property that might qualify for nomination is not inadvertently transferred, sold, demolished or substantially altered. The agency head shall refer any questionable actions to the Secretary of the Interior for an opinion respecting the property's eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The Secretary shall consult with the liaison officer for historic preservation for the State or territory involved in arriving at his opinion. Where, after a reasonable period in which to review and evaluate the property, the Secretary determines that the property is likely to meet the criteria prescribed for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, the Federal agency head shall reconsider the proposal in light of national environmental and preservation policy. Where, after such reconsideration, the Federal agency head proposes to transfer, sell, demolish or substantially alter the property he shall not act with respect to the property until the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation shall have been provided an opportunity to comment on the proposal.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) initiate measures to assure that where as a result of Federal action or assistance a property listed on the National Register of Historic Places is to be substantially altered or demolished, timely steps be taken to make or have made records, including measured drawings, photographs and maps, of the property, and that copy of such records then be deposited in the Library of Congress as part of the Historic American Buildings Survey or Historic American Engineering Record for future use and reference. Agencies may call on the Department of the Interior for advice and technical assistance in the completion of the above records.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) initiate measures and procedures to provide for the maintenance, through preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration, of federally owned and registered sites at professional standards prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) submit procedures required pursuant to subsection (d) to the Secretary of the Interior and to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation no later than January 1, 1972, and annually thereafter, for review and comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) cooperate with purchasers and transferees of a property listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the development of viable plans to use such property in a manner compatible with preservation objectives and which does not result in an unreasonable economic burden to public or private interests.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior</i>. The Secretary of the Interior shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) encourage State and local historic preservation officials to evaluate and survey federally owned historic properties and, where appropriate, to nominate such properties for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) develop criteria and procedures to be applied by Federal agencies in the reviews and nominations required by section 2(a). Such criteria and procedures shall be developed in consultation with the affected agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) expedite action upon nominations to the National Register of Historic Places concerning federally owned properties proposed for sale, transfer, demolition or substantial alteration.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) encourage State and Territorial liaison officers for historic preservation to furnish information upon request to Federal agencies regarding their properties which have been evaluated with respect to historic, architectural or archaeological significance and which as a result of such evaluations have not been found suitable for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) develop and make available to Federal agencies and State and local governments information concerning professional methods and techniques for preserving, improving, restoring and maintaining historic properties.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) advise Federal agencies in the evaluation, identification, preservation, improvement, restoration and maintenance of historic properties.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) review and evaluate the plans of transferees of surplus Federal properties transferred for historic monument purposes to assure that the historic character of such properties is preserved in rehabilitation, restoration, improvement, maintenance and repair of such properties.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13287. Preserve America</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13287, Mar. 3, 2003, 68 F.R. 10635, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Historic Preservation Act ([former] 16 U.S.C. 470 <i>et seq.</i>) [see 54 U.S.C. 300301 et seq.] (NHPA) and the National Environmental Policy Act [of 1969] (42 U.S.C. 4321 <i>et seq.</i>), it is hereby ordered:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Statement of Policy</i>. It is the policy of the Federal Government to provide leadership in preserving America's heritage by actively advancing the protection, enhancement, and contemporary use of the historic properties owned by the Federal Government, and by promoting intergovernmental cooperation and partnerships for the preservation and use of historic properties. The Federal Government shall recognize and manage the historic properties in its ownership as assets that can support department and agency missions while contributing to the vitality and economic well-being of the Nation's communities and fostering a broader appreciation for the development of the United States and its underlying values. Where consistent with executive branch department and agency missions, governing law, applicable preservation standards, and where appropriate, executive branch departments and agencies ("agency" or "agencies") shall advance this policy through the protection and continued use of the historic properties owned by the Federal Government, and by pursuing partnerships with State and local governments, Indian tribes, and the private sector to promote the preservation of the unique cultural heritage of communities and of the Nation and to realize the economic benefit that these properties can provide. Agencies shall maximize efforts to integrate the policies, procedures, and practices of the NHPA and this order into their program activities in order to efficiently and effectively advance historic preservation objectives in the pursuit of their missions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Building Preservation Partnerships</i>. When carrying out its mission activities, each agency, where consistent with its mission and governing authorities, and where appropriate, shall seek partnerships with State and local governments, Indian tribes, and the private sector to promote local economic development and vitality through the use of historic properties in a manner that contributes to the long-term preservation and productive use of those properties. Each agency shall examine its policies, procedures, and capabilities to ensure that its actions encourage, support, and foster public-private initiatives and investment in the use, reuse, and rehabilitation of historic properties, to the extent such support is not inconsistent with other provisions of law, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Archeology and Historic Preservation, and essential national department and agency mission requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Improving Federal Agency Planning and Accountability</i>. (a) Accurate information on the state of Federally owned historic properties is essential to achieving the goals of this order and to promoting community economic development through local partnerships. Each agency with real property management responsibilities shall prepare an assessment of the current status of its inventory of historic properties required by section 110(a)(2) of the NHPA ([former] 16 U.S.C. 470h–2(a)(2)) [see 54 U.S.C. 306102], the general condition and management needs of such properties, and the steps underway or planned to meet those management needs. The assessment shall also include an evaluation of the suitability of the agency's types of historic properties to contribute to community economic development initiatives, including heritage tourism, taking into account agency mission needs, public access considerations, and the long-term preservation of the historic properties. No later than September 30, 2004, each covered agency shall complete a report of the assessment and make it available to the Chairman of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council) and the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) No later than September 30, 2004, each agency with real property management responsibilities shall review its regulations, management policies, and operating procedures for compliance with sections 110 and 111 of the NHPA [former] (16 U.S.C. 470h–2 & 470[h]–3 [see 54 U.S.C. 306101 to 306107, 306109 to 306114, 306121, 306122]) and make the results of its review available to the Council and the Secretary. If the agency determines that its regulations, management policies, and operating procedures are not in compliance with those authorities, the agency shall make amendments or revisions to bring them into compliance.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Each agency with real property management responsibilities shall, by September 30, 2005, and every third year thereafter, prepare a report on its progress in identifying, protecting, and using historic properties in its ownership and make the report available to the Council and the Secretary. The Council shall incorporate this data into a report on the state of the Federal Government's historic properties and their contribution to local economic development and submit this report to the President by February 15, 2006, and every third year thereafter.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies may use existing information gathering and reporting systems to fulfill the assessment and reporting requirements of subsections 3(a)–(c) of this order. To assist agencies, the Council, in consultation with the Secretary, shall, by September 30, 2003, prepare advisory guidelines for agencies to use at their discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) No later than June 30, 2003, the head of each agency shall designate a senior policy level official to have policy oversight responsibility for the agency's historic preservation program and notify the Council and the Secretary of the designation. This senior official shall be an assistant secretary, deputy assistant secretary, or the equivalent, as appropriate to the agency organization. This official, or a subordinate employee reporting directly to the official, shall serve as the agency's Federal Preservation Officer in accordance with section 110(c) of the NHPA [see 54 U.S.C. 306104]. The senior official shall ensure that the Federal Preservation Officer is qualified consistent with guidelines established by the Secretary for that position and has access to adequate expertise and support to carry out the duties of the position.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Improving Federal Stewardship of Historic Properties</i>. (a) Each agency shall ensure that the management of historic properties in its ownership is conducted in a manner that promotes the long-term preservation and use of those properties as Federal assets and, where consistent with agency missions, governing law, and the nature of the properties, contributes to the local community and its economy.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Where consistent with agency missions and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Archeology and Historic Preservation, and where appropriate, agencies shall cooperate with communities to increase opportunities for public benefit from, and access to, Federally owned historic properties.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Council is directed to use its existing authority to encourage and accept donations of money, equipment, and other resources from public and private parties to assist other agencies in the preservation of historic properties in Federal ownership to fulfill the goals of the NHPA and this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The National Park Service, working with the Council and in consultation with other agencies, shall make available existing materials and information for education, training, and awareness of historic property stewardship to ensure that all Federal personnel have access to information and can develop the skills necessary to continue the productive use of Federally owned historic properties while meeting their stewardship responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Council, in consultation with the National Park Service and other agencies, shall encourage and recognize exceptional achievement by such agencies in meeting the goals of the NHPA and this order. By March 31, 2004, the Council shall submit to the President and the heads of agencies recommendations to further stimulate initiative, creativity, and efficiency in the Federal stewardship of historic properties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Promoting Preservation Through Heritage Tourism.</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) To the extent permitted by law and within existing resources, the Secretary of Commerce, working with the Council and other agencies, shall assist States, Indian tribes, and local communities in promoting the use of historic properties for heritage tourism and related economic development in a manner that contributes to the long-term preservation and productive use of those properties. Such assistance shall include efforts to strengthen and improve heritage tourism activities throughout the country as they relate to Federally owned historic properties and significant natural assets on Federal lands.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Where consistent with agency missions and governing law, and where appropriate, agencies shall use historic properties in their ownership in conjunction with State, tribal, and local tourism programs to foster viable economic partnerships, including, but not limited to, cooperation and coordination with tourism officials and others with interests in the properties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>National and Homeland Security Considerations.</i></p>
<p class="note-body">Nothing in this order shall be construed to require any agency to take any action or disclose any information that would conflict with or compromise national and homeland security goals, policies, programs, or activities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <i>Definitions</i>. For the purposes of this order, the term "historic property" means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, and object included on or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places in accordance with section 301(5) of the NHPA ([former] 16 U.S.C. 470w(5)) [see 54 U.S.C. 300308]. The term "heritage tourism" means the business and practice of attracting and accommodating visitors to a place or area based especially on the unique or special aspects of that locale's history, landscape (including trail systems), and culture. The terms "Federally owned" and "in Federal ownership," and similar terms, as used in this order, do not include properties acquired by agencies as a result of foreclosure or similar actions and that are held for a period of less than 5 years.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <i>Judicial Review</i>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the Federal Government and it is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
