<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Director of the Government Publishing Office shall appoint from time to time a disbursing officer of the Government Publishing Office (including the Office of the Superintendent of Documents) who shall be under the direction of the Director of the Government Publishing Office. The disbursing officer shall (1) disburse moneys of the Government Publishing Office only upon, and in strict accordance with, vouchers certified by the Director of the Government Publishing Office or by an officer or employee of the Government Publishing Office authorized in writing by the Director of the Government Publishing Office to certify such vouchers, (2) make such examination of vouchers as may be necessary to ascertain whether they are in proper form, certified, and approved, and (3) be held accountable accordingly. However, the disbursing officer shall not be held accountable or responsible for any illegal, improper, or incorrect payment resulting from any false, inaccurate, or misleading certificate, the responsibility for which, under subsection (c) of this section, is imposed upon a certifying officer or employee of the Government Publishing Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Upon the death, resignation, or separation from office of the disbursing officer, the accounts of the disbursing officer may be continued, and payments and collection may be made in the name of the disbursing officer, by any individual designated as a deputy disbursing officer by the Director of the Government Publishing Office, for a period of time not to extend beyond the last day of the second month following the month in which the death, resignation, or separation occurred. Accounts and payments shall be allowed, audited, and settled, and checks signed in the name of the former disbursing officer by a deputy disbursing officer shall be honored in the same manner as if the former disbursing officer had continued in office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A former disbursing officer of the Government Publishing Office or the estate of the disbursing officer may not be subject to any legal liability or penalty for the official accounts or defaults of the deputy disbursing officer acting in the name or in the place of the former disbursing officer. Each deputy disbursing officer is responsible for accounts entrusted to the deputy disbursing officer under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and the deputy disbursing officer is liable for any default occurring during the service of the deputy disbursing officer under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Director of the Government Publishing Office may designate in writing officers and employees of the Government Publishing Office to certify vouchers for payment from appropriations and funds. Such officers and employees shall (A) be responsible for the existence and correctness of the facts recited in the certificate or other voucher or its supporting papers and for the legality of the proposed payment under the appropriation or fund involved, (B) be responsible and accountable for the correctness of the computations of certified vouchers, and (C) be accountable for, and required to make restitution to, the United States for the amount of any illegal, improper, or incorrect payment resulting from any false, inaccurate, or misleading certificate made by such officer or employee, as well as for any payment prohibited by law or which did not represent a legal obligation under the appropriation or fund involved. However, the Comptroller General of the United States, may, at the discretion of the Comptroller General, relieve such certifying officer or employee of liability for any payment otherwise proper whenever the Comptroller General finds that (i) the certification was based on the official records and that such certifying officer or employee did not know, and by reasonable diligence and inquiry could not have ascertained, the actual facts, or (ii) when the obligation was incurred in good faith, the payment was not contrary to any statutory provision specifically prohibiting payments of the character involved, and the United States has received value for such payment. The Comptroller General shall relieve such certifying officer or employee of liability for an overpayment for transportation services made to any common carrier covered by section 3726 of title 31, whenever the Comptroller General finds that the overpayment occurred solely because the administrative examination made prior to payment of the transportation bill did not include a verification of transportation rates, freight classifications, or land grant deductions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The liability of such certifying officers or employees shall be enforced in the same manner and to the same extent as provided by law with respect to the enforcement of the liability of disbursing and other accountable officers. Such certifying officers and employees shall have the right to apply for and obtain a decision by the Comptroller General on any question of law involved in a payment on any vouchers presented to them for certification.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">"This Act may be cited as the &apos;Vegetable Ink Printing Act of 1994&apos;."</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">"SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">"(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) More than 95 percent of Federal printing involving documents or publications is performed using lithographic inks.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) Various types of oil, including petroleum and vegetable oil, are used in lithographic ink.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) Increasing the amount of vegetable oil used in a lithographic ink would—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(A) help reduce the Nation's use of nonrenewable energy resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(B) result in the use of products that are less damaging to the environment;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(C) result in a reduction of volatile organic compound emissions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(D) increase the use of renewable agricultural products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) The technology exists to use vegetable oil in lithographic ink and, in some applications, to use lithographic ink that uses no petroleum distillates in the liquid portion of the ink.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(5) Some lithographic inks have contained vegetable oils for many years; other lithographic inks have more recently begun to use vegetable oil.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(6) According to the Government Publishing Office, using vegetable oil-based ink appears to add little if any additional cost to Government printing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(7) Use of vegetable oil-based ink in Federal Government printing should further develop—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(A) the commercial viability of vegetable oil-based ink, which could result in demand, for domestic use alone, for 2,500,000,000 pounds of vegetable crops or 500,000,000 pounds of vegetable oil; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(B) a product that could help the United States retain or enlarge its share of the world market for vegetable oil-ink.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.—The purpose of this Act is to require that all lithographic printing using ink containing oil that is performed or procured by a Federal agency shall use ink containing the maximum amounts of vegetable oil and materials derived from other renewable resources that—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) are technologically feasible, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) result in printing costs that are competitive with printing using petroleum-based inks.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">"SEC. 3. FEDERAL PRINTING REQUIREMENTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">"(a) <cap-smallcap>General Rule</cap-smallcap>.—Notwithstanding any other law, and except as provided in subsection (b), a Federal agency may not perform or procure lithographic printing that uses ink containing oil if the ink contains less than the following percentage of vegetable oil:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) In the case of news ink, 40 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) In the case of sheet-fed ink, 20 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) In the case of forms ink, 20 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) In the case of heat-set ink, 10 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(b) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions.—</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) <cap-smallcap>Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.—Subsection (a) shall not apply to lithographic printing performed or procured by a Federal agency, if—</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(A) the head of the agency determines, after consultation with the Director of the Government Publishing Office and within the 3-year period ending on the date of the commencement of the printing or the date of that procurement, respectively, that vegetable oil-based ink is not suitable to meet specific, identified requirements of the agency related to the printing; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">"(B) the Director of the Government Publishing Office determines—</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">"(i) within the 3-month period ending on the date of the commencement of the printing, in the case of printing of materials that are printed at intervals of less than 6 months, or</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">"(ii) before the date of the commencement of the printing, in the case of printing of materials that are printed at intervals of 6 months or more;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush0_hang2">  that the cost of performing the printing using vegetable oil-based ink is significantly greater than the cost of performing the printing using other available ink.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) <cap-smallcap>Notice to congress</cap-smallcap>.—Not later than 30 days after making a determination under paragraph (1)(A), the head of a Federal agency shall report the determination to the Committee on Government Operations [now Committee on Oversight and Government Reform] and the Committee on House Administration of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Rules of the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(c) <cap-smallcap>Federal Agency Defined</cap-smallcap>.—In this Act, the term &apos;Federal agency&apos; means—</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) an executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government-controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) an establishment or component of the legislative or judicial branch of the Government."</p>

<p class="note-body">"(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to (A) individual printing orders costing not more than $1,000, if the work is not of a continuing or repetitive nature, and, as certified by the Director of the Government Publishing Office, if the work is included in a class of work which cannot be provided more economically through the Government Publishing Office, (B) printing for the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or the National Security Agency, or (C) printing from other sources that is specifically authorized by law.</p>

A greater number may not be printed unless ordered by either House, or as provided by this section. When a special number of a document or report is ordered printed, the usual number shall also be printed, unless already ordered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The "usual number" of documents and reports shall be one thousand six hundred and eighty-two copies, which shall be printed at one time and distributed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the House documents and reports, unbound—to the Senate document room, one hundred and fifty copies; to the office of the Secretary of the Senate, ten copies; to the House document room, not to exceed five hundred copies; to the office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, twenty copies; to the Library of Congress, ten copies, as provided by section 1718 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the Senate documents and reports, unbound—to the Senate document room, two hundred and twenty copies; office of the Secretary of the Senate, ten copies; to the House document room, not to exceed five hundred copies; to the Clerk's office of the House of Representatives, ten copies; to the Library of Congress, ten copies, as provided by section 1718 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Of the number printed, the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall bind a sufficient number of copies for distribution as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the House documents and reports, bound—to the Senate library, fifteen copies; to the Library of Congress, not to exceed one hundred and fifty copies, as provided by section 1718 of this title; to the House of Representatives library, fifteen copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, as many copies as are required for distribution to the State libraries and designated depositories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the Senate documents and reports, bound—to the Senate library, fifteen copies; to the Library of Congress, copies as provided by sections 1718 and 1719 of this title; to the House of Representatives library, fifteen copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, as many copies as may be required for distribution to State libraries and designated depositories. In binding documents the Director of the Government Publishing Office shall give precedence to those that are to be distributed to libraries and to designated depositories. But a State library or designated depository entitled to documents that may prefer to have its documents in unbound form, may do so by notifying the Superintendent of Documents to that effect prior to the convening of each Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The usual number of reports on private bills, concurrent or simple resolutions, may not be printed. Instead there shall be printed of each Senate report on a private bill, simple or concurrent resolution, in addition to those required to be furnished the Library of Congress, three hundred and forty-five copies, which shall be distributed as follows: to the Senate document room, two hundred and twenty copies; to the Secretary of the Senate, fifteen copies; to the House document room, one hundred copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, ten copies; and of each House report on a private bill, simple or concurrent resolution, in addition to those for the Library of Congress, two hundred and sixty copies, which shall be distributed as follows: to the Senate document room, one hundred and thirty-five copies; to the Secretary of the Senate, fifteen copies; to the House document room, one hundred copies; to the Superintendent of Documents, ten copies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not prevent the binding of all Senate and House reports in the reserve volumes bound for and delivered to the Senate and House libraries, nor abridge the right of the Vice President, Senators, Representatives, Resident Commissioner, Secretary of the Senate, and Clerk of the House to have bound in half morocco, or material not more expensive, one copy of every public document to which he may be entitled. At least twelve copies of each report on bills for the payment or adjudication of claims against the Government shall be kept on file in the Senate document room.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the prices of nautical products may be increased over a period of not less than three years after the date of enactment of this section so as to recover all costs attributable to data base management, compilation, printing, and distribution of such products. The prices of such products may be maintained to recover all such costs thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall adjust the prices of nautical products in such manner as is necessary to avoid any adverse impact on marine safety attributable to the prices specified in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section shall not be construed to require the establishment of any price for a nautical product where, in the judgment of the Secretary, furnishing of that product to a recipient is a reasonable exchange for voluntary contribution of information by the recipient to a program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Prices established under this section may not include costs attributable to the acquisition or processing of nautical data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Fees collected from the sale of nautical products under this section and from any licensing of such products which is permitted under any other provision of law shall be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts fund of the United States Treasury.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) all Government records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should be preserved for historical and governmental purposes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) all Government records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate disclosure, and all records should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) legislation is necessary to create an enforceable, independent, and accountable process for the public disclosure of such records;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) legislation is necessary because congressional records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy would not otherwise be subject to public disclosure until at least the year 2029;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(5) legislation is necessary because the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552], as implemented by the executive branch, has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(6) legislation is necessary because [former] Executive Order No. 12356, entitled &apos;National Security Information&apos; has eliminated the declassification and downgrading schedules relating to classified information across government and has prevented the timely public disclosure of records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Archivist shall be responsible for the custody, use, and withdrawal of records transferred to him. When records, the use of which is subject to statutory limitations and restrictions, are so transferred, permissive and restrictive statutory provisions with respect to the examination and use of records applicable to the head of the agency from which the records were transferred or to employees of that agency are applicable to the Archivist and to the employees of the National Archives and Records Administration, respectively. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, when the head of a Federal agency states, in writing, restrictions that appear to him to be necessary or desirable in the public interest with respect to the use or examination of records being considered for transfer from his custody to the Archivist, the Archivist shall, if he concurs,,<sup><a href="#2108_1_target" name="2108_1">1</a></sup> impose such restrictions on the records so transferred, and may not relax or remove such restrictions without the written concurrence of the head of the agency from which the material was transferred, or of his successor in function, if any. In the event that a Federal agency is terminated and there is no successor in function, the Archivist is authorized to relax, remove, or impose restrictions on such agency's records when he determines that such action is in the public interest. Statutory and other restrictions referred to in this subsection shall remain in force until the records have been in existence for thirty years unless the Archivist by order, having consulted with the head of the transferring Federal agency or his successor in function, determines, with respect to specific bodies of records, that for reasons consistent with standards established in relevant statutory law, such restrictions shall remain in force for a longer period. Restriction on the use or examination of records deposited with the National Archives of the United States imposed by section 3 of the National Archives Act, approved June 19, 1934, shall continue in force regardless of the expiration of the tenure of office of the official who imposed them but may be removed or relaxed by the Archivist with the concurrence in writing of the head of the agency from which material was transferred or of his successor in function, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) With regard to the census and survey records of the Bureau of the Census containing data identifying individuals enumerated in population censuses, any release pursuant to this section of such identifying information contained in such records shall be made by the Archivist pursuant to the specifications and agreements set forth in the exchange of correspondence on or about the date of October 10, 1952, between the Director of the Bureau of the Census and the Archivist of the United States, together with all amendments thereto, now or hereafter entered into between the Director of the Bureau of the Census and the Archivist of the United States. Such amendments, if any, shall be published in the Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount which, pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, would have been required to have been available for deposit in such endowment with respect to such depository if such change or addition had been included in such depository on—</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In this subparagraph, the term "base endowment amount" means the amount of the endowment required under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) The Archivist may give credits against the base endowment amount if the Archivist determines that the proposed Presidential archival depository will have construction features or equipment that are expected to result in quantifiable long-term savings to the Government with respect to the cost of facility operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) The features and equipment described under subclause (I) shall comply with the standards promulgated by the Archivist under subsection (a)(2).</p>

For the purpose of this section, continuity of session is broken only by an adjournment of Congress sine die, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three days to a day certain are excluded in the computation of the days in which Congress is in continuous session.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Archivist shall request the advice of the Committee on Rules and Administration and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on House Oversight and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives with respect to any proposed disposal of Presidential records whenever the Archivist considers that—</p>

The Archivist shall have an affirmative duty to make such records available to the public as rapidly and completely as possible consistent with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Archivist shall deposit all such Presidential records in a Presidential archival depository or another archival facility operated by the United States.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) When the President considers it practicable and in the public interest, the President shall include in the President's budget transmitted to Congress, for each fiscal year in which the term of office of the President will expire, such funds as may be necessary for carrying out the authorities of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Archivist is authorized to dispose of such Presidential records which the Archivist has appraised and determined to have insufficient administrative, historical, informational, or evidentiary value to warrant their continued preservation. Notice of such disposal shall be published in the Federal Register at least 60 days in advance of the proposed disposal date. Publication of such notice shall constitute a final agency action for purposes of review under chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Definitions</i>. For purposes of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) "Archivist" refers to the Archivist of the United States or his designee.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) "NARA" refers to the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) "Presidential Records Act" refers to the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2201–2207.</p>

<p class="note-body">(f) "Former President" refers to the former President during whose term or terms of office particular Presidential records were created.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) A "substantial question of executive privilege" exists if NARA's disclosure of Presidential records might impair national security (including the conduct of foreign relations), law enforcement, or the deliberative processes of the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) A "final court order" is a court order from which no appeal may be taken.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Notice of Intent to Disclose Presidential Records</i>. (a) When the Archivist provides notice to the incumbent and former Presidents of his intent to disclose Presidential records pursuant to section 1270.46 of the NARA regulations, the Archivist, using any guidelines provided by the incumbent and former Presidents, shall identify any specific materials, the disclosure of which he believes may raise a substantial question of executive privilege. However, nothing in this order is intended to affect the right of the incumbent or former Presidents to invoke executive privilege with respect to materials not identified by the Archivist. Copies of the notice for the incumbent President shall be delivered to the President (through the Counsel to the President) and the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President shall be delivered to the former President or his designated representative.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Upon the passage of 30 days after receipt by the incumbent and former Presidents of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential records, the Archivist may disclose the records covered by the notice, unless during that time period the Archivist has received a claim of executive privilege by the incumbent or former President or the Archivist has been instructed by the incumbent President or his designee to extend the time period for a time certain and with reason for the extension of time provided in the notice. If a shorter period of time is required under the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations, the Archivist shall so indicate in the notice.</p>

(a) Upon receipt of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential records, the Attorney General (directly or through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel) and the Counsel to the President shall review as they deem appropriate the records covered by the notice and consult with each other, the Archivist, and such other executive agencies as they deem appropriate concerning whether invocation of executive privilege is justified.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Attorney General and the Counsel to the President, in the exercise of their discretion and after appropriate review and consultation under subsection (a) of this section, may jointly determine that invocation of executive privilege is not justified. The Archivist shall be notified promptly of any such determination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) If either the Attorney General or the Counsel to the President believes that the circumstances justify invocation of executive privilege, the issue shall be presented to the President by the Counsel to the President and the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) If the President decides to invoke executive privilege, the Counsel to the President shall notify the former President, the Archivist, and the Attorney General in writing of the claim of privilege and the specific Presidential records to which it relates. After receiving such notice, the Archivist shall not disclose the privileged records unless directed to do so by an incumbent President or by a final court order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Claim of Executive Privilege by Former President</i>. (a) Upon receipt of a claim of executive privilege by a living former President, the Archivist shall consult with the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel), the Counsel to the President, and such other executive agencies as the Archivist deems appropriate concerning the Archivist's determination as to whether to honor the former President's claim of privilege or instead to disclose the Presidential records notwithstanding the claim of privilege. Any determination under section 3 of this order that executive privilege shall not be invoked by the incumbent President shall not prejudice the Archivist's determination with respect to the former President's claim of privilege.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In making the determination referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Archivist shall abide by any instructions given him by the incumbent President or his designee unless otherwise directed by a final court order. The Archivist shall notify the incumbent and former Presidents of his determination at least 30 days prior to disclosure of the Presidential records, unless a shorter time period is required in the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations. Copies of the notice for the incumbent President shall be delivered to the President (through the Counsel to the President) and the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President shall be delivered to the former President or his designated representative.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Managing Government Records</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Nov. 28, 2011, 76 F.R. 75423, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Purpose</i>. This memorandum begins an executive branch-wide effort to reform records management policies and practices. Improving records management will improve performance and promote openness and accountability by better documenting agency actions and decisions. Records transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provide the prism through which future generations will understand and learn from our actions and decisions. Modernized records management will also help executive departments and agencies (agencies) minimize costs and operate more efficiently. Improved records management thus builds on Executive Order 13589 of November 9, 2011 (Promoting Efficient Spending), which directed agencies to reduce spending and focus on mission-critical functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">When records are well-managed, agencies can use them to assess the impact of programs, to reduce redundant efforts, to save money, and to share knowledge within and across their organizations. In these ways, proper records management is the backbone of open Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Decades of technological advances have transformed agency operations, creating challenges and opportunities for agency records management. Greater reliance on electronic communication and systems has radically increased the volume and diversity of information that agencies must manage. With proper planning, technology can make these records less burdensome to manage and easier to use and share. But if records management policies and practices are not updated for a digital age, the surge in information could overwhelm agency systems, leading to higher costs and lost records.</p>
<p class="note-body">We must address these challenges while using the opportunity to develop a 21st-century framework for the management of Government records. This framework will provide a foundation for open Government, leverage information to improve agency performance, and reduce unnecessary costs and burdens.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Agency Commitments to Records Management Reform</i>. (a) The head of each agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) ensure that the successful implementation of records management requirements in law, regulation, and this memorandum is a priority for senior agency management;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) ensure that proper resources are allocated to the effective implementation of such requirements; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, designate in writing to the Archivist of the United States (Archivist), a senior agency official to supervise the review required by subsection (b) of this section, in coordination with the agency's Records Officer, Chief Information Officer, and General Counsel.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, each agency head shall submit a report to the Archivist and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) describes the agency's current plans for improving or maintaining its records management program, particularly with respect to managing electronic records, including email and social media, deploying cloud-based services or storage solutions, and meeting other records challenges;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) identifies any provisions, or omissions, in relevant statutes, regulations, or official NARA guidance that currently pose an obstacle to the agency's adoption of sound, cost-effective records management policies and practices; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) identifies policies or programs that, if included in the Records Management Directive required by section 3 of this memorandum or adopted or implemented by NARA, would assist the agency's efforts to improve records management.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The reports submitted pursuant to this subsection should supplement, and therefore need not duplicate, information provided by agencies to NARA pursuant to other reporting obligations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Records Management Directive</i>. (a) Within 120 days of the deadline for reports submitted pursuant to section 2(b) of this memorandum, the Director of OMB and the Archivist, in coordination with the Associate Attorney General, shall issue a Records Management Directive that directs agency heads to take specific steps to reform and improve records management policies and practices within their agency. The directive shall focus on:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) creating a Government-wide records management framework that is more efficient and cost-effective;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) promoting records management policies and practices that enhance the capability of agencies to fulfill their statutory missions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) maintaining accountability through documentation of agency actions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) increasing open Government and appropriate public access to Government records;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) supporting agency compliance with applicable legal requirements related to the preservation of information relevant to litigation; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) transitioning from paper-based records management to electronic records management where feasible.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In the course of developing the directive, the Archivist, in coordination with the Director of OMB and the Associate Attorney General, shall review relevant statutes, regulations, and official NARA guidance to identify opportunities for reforms that would facilitate improved Government-wide records management practices, particularly with respect to electronic records. The Archivist, in coordination with the Director of OMB and the Associate Attorney General, shall present to the President the results of this review, no later than the date of the directive's issuance, to facilitate potential updates to the laws, regulations, and policies governing the management of Federal records.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In developing the directive, the Director of OMB and the Archivist, in coordination with the Associate Attorney General, shall consult with other affected agencies, interagency groups, and public stakeholders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Publication</i>. The Archivist is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Archivist shall examine the lists and schedules submitted to the Archivist under section 3303 of this title. If the Archivist determines that any of the records listed in a list or schedule submitted to the Archivist do not, or will not after the lapse of the period specified, have sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant their continued preservation by the Government, the Archivist may, after publication of notice in the Federal Register and an opportunity for interested persons to submit comment thereon—</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Authorizations granted under lists and schedules submitted to the Archivist under section 3303 of this title, and schedules promulgated by the Archivist under subsection (d) of this section, shall be mandatory, subject to section 2909 of this title. As between an authorization granted under lists and schedules submitted to the Archivist under section 3303 of this title and an authorization contained in a schedule promulgated under subsection (d) of this section, application of the authorization providing for the shorter retention period shall be required, subject to section 2909 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Archivist may request advice and counsel from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate with respect to the disposal of any particular records under this chapter whenever the Archivist considers that—</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) those particular records may be of special interest to the Congress; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consultation with the Congress regarding the disposal of those particular records is in the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">However, this subsection does not require the Archivist to request such advice and counsel as a regular procedure in the general disposal of records under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Archivist shall promulgate schedules authorizing the disposal, after the lapse of specified periods of time, of records of a specified form or character common to several or all agencies if such records will not, at the end of the periods specified, have sufficient administrative, legal, research, or other value to warrant their further preservation by the United States Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Archivist may approve and effect the disposal of records that are in the Archivist's legal custody, provided that records that had been in the custody of another existing agency may not be disposed of without the written consent of the head of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Archivist shall make an annual report to the Congress concerning the disposal of records under this chapter, including general descriptions of the types of records disposed of and such other information as the Archivist considers appropriate to keep the Congress fully informed regarding the disposal of records under this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">"SEC. 521. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">"(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) Federal statistics are an important source of information for public and private decision-makers such as policymakers, consumers, businesses, investors, and workers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys. Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the economy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will improve their ability to track more accurately the large and rapidly changing nature of United States business. In particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better ensure that businesses are consistently classified in appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(5) The Congress enacted the International Investment and Trade in Services Act of 1990 [probably means the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act, Pub. L. 94–472, as amended by Pub. L. 101–533, which is classified to 22 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.] that allowed the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share data on foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 industries with no increase in the data collected from respondents but also demonstrated how data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(6) With subtitle A of this title, the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to ensure the highest level of confidentiality for respondents to statistical surveys.</p>
<p class="note-body">"(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.—The purposes of this subtitle are the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) To authorize the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) To reduce the paperwork burdens imposed on businesses that provide requested information to the Federal Government.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13556. Controlled Unclassified Information</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13556, Nov. 4, 2010, 75 F.R. 68675, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Purpose</i>. This order establishes an open and uniform program for managing information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Government-wide policies, excluding information that is classified under Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009, or the Atomic Energy Act, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">At present, executive departments and agencies (agencies) employ ad hoc, agency-specific policies, procedures, and markings to safeguard and control this information, such as information that involves privacy, security, proprietary business interests, and law enforcement investigations. This inefficient, confusing patchwork has resulted in inconsistent marking and safeguarding of documents, led to unclear or unnecessarily restrictive dissemination policies, and created impediments to authorized information sharing. The fact that these agency-specific policies are often hidden from public view has only aggravated these issues.</p>
<p class="note-body">To address these problems, this order establishes a program for managing this information, hereinafter described as Controlled Unclassified Information, that emphasizes the openness and uniformity of Government-wide practice.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The CUI categories and subcategories shall serve as exclusive designations for identifying unclassified information throughout the executive branch that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls, pursuant to and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Government-wide policies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The mere fact that information is designated as CUI shall not have a bearing on determinations pursuant to any law requiring the disclosure of information or permitting disclosure as a matter of discretion, including disclosures to the legislative or judicial branches.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The National Archives and Records Administration shall serve as the Executive Agent to implement this order and oversee agency actions to ensure compliance with this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Review of Current Designations.</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Each agency head shall, within 180 days of the date of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) review all categories, subcategories, and markings used by the agency to designate unclassified information for safeguarding or dissemination controls; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) submit to the Executive Agent a catalogue of proposed categories and subcategories of CUI, and proposed associated markings for information designated as CUI under section 2(a) of this order. This submission shall provide definitions for each proposed category and subcategory and identify the basis in law, regulation, or Government-wide policy for safeguarding or dissemination controls.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If there is significant doubt about whether information should be designated as CUI, it shall not be so designated.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Development of CUI Categories and Policies.</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) On the basis of the submissions under section 3 of this order or future proposals, and in consultation with affected agencies, the Executive Agent shall, in a timely manner, approve categories and subcategories of CUI and associated markings to be applied uniformly throughout the executive branch and to become effective upon publication in the registry established under subsection (d) of this section. No unclassified information meeting the requirements of section 2(a) of this order shall be disapproved for inclusion as CUI, but the Executive Agent may resolve conflicts among categories and subcategories of CUI to achieve uniformity and may determine the markings to be used.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Executive Agent, in consultation with affected agencies, shall develop and issue such directives as are necessary to implement this order. Such directives shall be made available to the public and shall provide policies and procedures concerning marking, safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol of CUI that, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, regulation, and Government-wide policies, shall remain consistent across categories and subcategories of CUI and throughout the executive branch. In developing such directives, appropriate consideration should be given to the report of the interagency Task Force on Controlled Unclassified Information published in August 2009. The Executive Agent shall issue initial directives for the implementation of this order within 180 days of the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Executive Agent shall convene and chair interagency meetings to discuss matters pertaining to the program established by this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Within 1 year of the date of this order, the Executive Agent shall establish and maintain a public CUI registry reflecting authorized CUI categories and subcategories, associated markings, and applicable safeguarding, dissemination, and decontrol procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) If the Executive Agent and an agency cannot reach agreement on an issue related to the implementation of this order, that issue may be appealed to the President through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) In performing its functions under this order, the Executive Agent, in accordance with applicable law, shall consult with representatives of the public and State, local, tribal, and private sector partners on matters related to approving categories and subcategories of CUI and developing implementing directives issued by the Executive Agent pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Implementation.</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Within 180 days of the issuance of initial policies and procedures by the Executive Agent in accordance with section 4(b) of this order, each agency that originates or handles CUI shall provide the Executive Agent with a proposed plan for compliance with the requirements of this order, including the establishment of interim target dates.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) After a review of agency plans, and in consultation with affected agencies and the Office of Management and Budget, the Executive Agent shall establish deadlines for phased implementation by agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In each of the first 5 years following the date of this order and biennially thereafter, the Executive Agent shall publish a report on the status of agency implementation of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>General Provisions.</i></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) applicable law, including protections of confidentiality and privacy rights;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the statutory authority of the heads of agencies, including authorities related to the protection of information provided by the private sector to the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) applicable Government-wide standards and guidelines issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and applicable policies established by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Director of National Intelligence (Director), with respect to the Intelligence Community and after consultation with the heads of affected agencies, may issue such policy directives and guidelines as the Director deems necessary to implement this order with respect to intelligence and intelligence-related information. Procedures or other guidance issued by Intelligence Community element heads shall be in accordance with such policy directives or guidelines issued by the Director. Any such policy directives or guidelines issued by the Director shall be in accordance with this order and directives issued by the Executive Agent.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order shall not be construed to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, and legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) This order shall be implemented subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The Attorney General, upon request by the head of an agency or the Executive Agent, shall render an interpretation of this order with respect to any question arising in the course of its administration.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Making It Easier for America's Small Businesses and America's Exporters to Access Government Services to Help Them Grow and Hire</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 2011, 76 F.R. 68049, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">As I outlined in my State of the Union address to the Congress on January 25, 2011, winning the future in the global economy will require a Government that wisely allocates its scarce resources to maximize efficiency and effectiveness so that it can best support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. If we are to thrive in the global economy, and make America the best place on Earth to do business, we need to equip our Government with the tools necessary to support innovation and job growth in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, we must make it easier for businesses to access the full range of Government programs and services without having to waste effort navigating their way through the Federal bureaucracy. At the same time, we must further streamline and coordinate Federal programs to reduce costs and provide customer-oriented service.</p>
<p class="note-body">Businesses looking for assistance from the Federal Government should feel like they are interacting with one entity, rather than a number of separate, albeit linked, components. This means adopting a "No Wrong Door" policy that uses technology to quickly connect businesses to the services and information relevant to them, regardless of which agency's website, call center, or office they go to for help.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, a business's interactions with the Federal Government should be individualized and efficient. If the private sector can allow consumers to customize interactions so that they receive only the information they want, in the form they want it, so can the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, I am directing a first wave of changes focused on both small businesses and businesses of all sizes that want to begin or increase exporting (exporters), because those businesses help drive economic growth and have the most to gain from Federal assistance. We plan to use the resulting improvements as a model for future reforms so that, in time, all businesses and all citizens receive the highest level of customer service when they interact with the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, I direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall work with a Steering Committee co-chaired by the Federal Chief Information Officer, Assistant to the President and Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Performance Officer (the Co-Chairs) to carry out the directives in this memorandum within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, unless a provision of this memorandum expressly states otherwise. The Steering Committee shall include senior policy and technical representatives, appointed by the heads of their respective agencies, from the Departments of State, Defense, Agriculture, Commerce, and Veterans Affairs, the Small Business Administration (SBA), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Export-Import Bank, and other agencies designated by the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chairs and representatives from the Department of Commerce and SBA shall serve as the Executive Committee of the Steering Committee, which shall coordinate the strategy, design, development, launch, and operation of BusinessUSA, a common, open, online platform and web service with dedicated resources that will, as a first step, disseminate core information regarding the Federal Government's programs and services relevant to small businesses and exporters.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Agencies shall work with the Steering Committee to develop and launch an introductory version of BusinessUSA. BusinessUSA shall be designed, tested, and built with the active feedback of U.S. businesses and relevant online communities. To the extent appropriate, practicable, and permitted by law, the BusinessUSA platform shall integrate related State and local government services as well as those of private sector partners.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Agencies shall make information regarding their small business and export programs and services accessible through BusinessUSA. To accomplish this in a uniform fashion, the Steering Committee shall develop a common set of standards for content available through BusinessUSA, which shall identify the types of programs and services to be included initially on BusinessUSA and a structure for organizing and presenting such information. These standards shall be used by all agencies in the creation, presentation, and delivery of information regarding their programs and services, to the extent practicable and permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Agencies shall also work with the Steering Committee to develop new content for BusinessUSA that synthesizes information available across agencies to better serve small businesses and exporters. Among other things, agencies shall work together to aggregate on the BusinessUSA platform statistical, demographic, and other raw Government datasets of particular interest to small businesses and exporters, making Government data more easily accessible and spurring innovative uses of the data through business-oriented web or mobile applications.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Agencies shall integrate BusinessUSA, including ready access to the BusinessUSA website, into their current websites, call centers, and field offices to ensure that small businesses and exporters have access to the wide range of Government programs and services at each entry point into the Federal Government. During the year following the date of this memorandum, agencies shall work with GSA and the Office of Management and Budget to enhance the centralized call center for responding to public questions about Federal programs and services (1–800–FED–INFO) to add expertise with Government programs and services for small businesses and exporters.</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) BusinessUSA shall be operated by a single hosting agency under the Executive Committee's coordination. To the extent permitted by law, agencies shall reimburse the hosting agency for the cost of establishing, maintaining, and operating BusinessUSA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">The American people expect reliable service from their Government and deserve the confidence that critical government functions dependent on electronic systems will be performed accurately and in a timely manner. Because of a design feature in many electronic systems, a large number of activities in the public and private sectors could be at risk beginning in the year 2000. Some computer systems and other electronic devices will misinterpret the year "00" as 1900, rather than 2000. Unless appropriate action is taken, this flaw, known as the "Y2K problem," can cause systems that support those functions to compute erroneously or simply not run. Minimizing the Y2K problem will require a major technological and managerial effort, and it is critical that the United States Government do its part in addressing this challenge.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <i>Policy</i>. (a) It shall be the policy of the executive branch that agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) assure that no critical Federal program experiences disruption because of the Y2K problem;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) assist and cooperate with State, local, and tribal governments to address the Y2K problem where those governments depend on Federal information or information technology or the Federal Government is dependent on those governments to perform critical missions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) cooperate with the private sector operators of critical national and local systems, including the banking and financial system, the telecommunications system, the public health system, the transportation system, and the electric power generation system, in addressing the Y2K problem; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) communicate with their foreign counterparts to raise awareness of and generate cooperative international arrangements to address the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As used in this order, "agency" and "agencies" refer to Federal agencies that are not in the judicial or legislative branches.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <i>Year 2000 Conversion Council</i>. There is hereby established the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion (the "Council").</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Council shall be led by a Chair who shall be an Assistant to the President, and it shall be composed of one representative from each of the executive departments and from such other Federal agencies as may be determined by the Chair of the Council (the "Chair").</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Chair shall appoint a Vice Chair and assign other responsibilities for operations of the council as he or she deems necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Chair shall oversee the activities of agencies to assure that their systems operate smoothly through the year 2000, act as chief spokesperson on this issue for the executive branch in national and international fora, provide policy coordination of executive branch activities with State, local, and tribal governments on the Y2K problem, and promote appropriate Federal roles with respect to private sector activities in this area.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Chair and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall report jointly at least quarterly to me on the progress of agencies in addressing the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Chair shall identify such resources from agencies as the Chair deems necessary for the implementation of the policies set out in this order, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <i>Responsibilities of Agency Heads</i>. (a) The head of each agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) assure that efforts to address the Y2K problem receive the highest priority attention in the agency and that the policies established in this order are carried out; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) cooperate to the fullest extent with the Chair by making available such information, support, and assistance, including personnel, as the Chair may request to support the accomplishment of the tasks assigned herein, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The heads of executive departments and the agencies designated by the Chair under section 2(a) of this order shall identify a responsible official to represent the head of the executive department or agency on the Council with sufficient authority and experience to commit agency resources to address the Y2K problem.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <i>Responsibilities of Interagency and Executive Office Councils</i>. Interagency councils and councils within the Executive Office of the President, including the President's Management Council, the Chief Information Officers Council, the Chief Financial Officers Council, the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency, the National Science and Technology Council, the National Performance Review, the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National Security Council shall provide assistance and support to the Chair upon the Chair's request.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <i>Information Coordination Center</i>. (a) To assist the Chair in the Y2K response duties included under section 2(c) of this order, there shall be established the Information Coordination Center (ICC) in the General Services Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) At the direction of the Chair, the ICC will assist in making preparations for information sharing and coordination within the Federal Government and key components of the public and private sectors, coordinating agency assessments of Y2K emergencies that could have an adverse affect on U.S. interests at home and abroad, and, if necessary, assisting Federal agencies and the Chair in reconstitution processes where appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The ICC will:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) consist of officials from executive agencies, designated by agency heads under subsection 3(a)(2) of this order, who have expertise in important management and technical areas, computer hardware, software or security systems, reconstitution and recovery, and of additional personnel hired directly or by contract, as required, to carry out the duties described under section 5 of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) work with the Council and the Office of Management and Budget to assure that Federal efforts to restore critical systems are coordinated with efforts managed by Federal agencies acting under existing emergency response authorities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Chair of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion shall designate a Director of the ICC.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <i>Judicial Review</i>. This Executive order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The task force shall—</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) make recommendations to improve the electronic dissemination of information collected under Federal requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) recommend a plan for the development of an interactive Governmentwide system, available through the Internet, to allow each small business to—</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more easily comply with those Federal requirements; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Individuals, businesses, and other organizations have varying degrees of legal protection when providing information to the agencies for strictly statistical purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Pledges of confidentiality by agencies provide assurances to the public that information about individuals or organizations or provided by individuals or organizations for exclusively statistical purposes will be held in confidence and will not be used against such individuals or organizations in any agency action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Protecting the confidentiality interests of individuals or organizations who provide information under a pledge of confidentiality for Federal statistical programs serves both the interests of the public and the needs of society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Declining trust of the public in the protection of information provided under a pledge of confidentiality to the agencies adversely affects both the accuracy and completeness of statistical analyses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Ensuring that information provided under a pledge of confidentiality for statistical purposes receives protection is essential in continuing public cooperation in statistical programs.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Federal statistics are an important source of information for public and private decision-makers such as policymakers, consumers, businesses, investors, and workers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys. Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will improve their ability to track more accurately the large and rapidly changing nature of United States business. In particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better ensure that businesses are consistently classified in appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Congress enacted the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (Public Law 94–472), which allowed the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share data on foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 industries with no increase in the data collected from respondents but also demonstrated how data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) With part B of this subchapter, the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to ensure the highest level of confidentiality for respondents to statistical surveys.</p>

<p class="note-body">"(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.—Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly transforming societal interactions and the relationships among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in applying advances in information technology to enhance governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient performance, increase access to Government information, and increase citizen participation in Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government are developed and presented separately, according to the jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according to function or topic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(4) Internet-based Government services involving interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved Government performance and outcomes within and across agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">"(6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the management of Government, to be implemented as part of a management framework that also addresses finance, procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve the performance of Government.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Building a 21st Century Digital Government</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 23, 2012, 77 F.R. 32391, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The innovative use of technology is fundamentally transforming how the American people do business and live their daily lives. Exponential increases in computing power, the rise of high-speed networks, and the growing mobile revolution have put the Internet at our fingertips, encouraging innovations that are giving rise to new industries and reshaping existing ones.</p>
<p class="note-body">Innovators in the private sector and the Federal Government have used these technological advances to fundamentally change how they serve their customers. However, it is time for the Federal Government to do more. For far too long, the American people have been forced to navigate a labyrinth of information across different Government programs in order to find the services they need. In addition, at a time when Americans increasingly pay bills and buy tickets on mobile devices, Government services often are not optimized for smartphones or tablets, assuming the services are even available online.</p>
<p class="note-body">On April 27, 2011, I issued Executive Order 13571 (Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service), requiring executive departments and agencies (agencies) to, among other things, identify ways to use innovative technologies to streamline their delivery of services to lower costs, decrease service delivery times, and improve the customer experience. As the next step toward modernizing the way Government works, I charged my Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) with developing a comprehensive Government-wide strategy to build a 21st century digital Government that delivers better digital services to the American people.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, the CIO is releasing that strategy, entitled "Digital Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the American People" (Strategy), which provides agencies with a 12-month roadmap that focuses on several priority areas. The Strategy will enable more efficient and coordinated digital service delivery by requiring agencies to establish specific, measurable goals for delivering better digital services; encouraging agencies to deliver information in new ways that fully utilize the power and potential of mobile and web-based technologies; ensuring the safe and secure delivery and use of digital services to protect information and privacy; requiring agencies to establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt new standards for making applicable Government information open and machine-readable by default; aggregating agencies&apos; online resource pages for developers in a centralized catalogue on www.Data.gov; and requiring agencies to use web performance analytics and customer satisfaction measurement tools on all ".gov" websites.</p>
<p class="note-body">Ultimately, this Strategy will ensure that agencies use emerging technologies to serve the public as effectively as possible. As a Government, and as a trusted provider of services, we must never forget who our customers are—the American people.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to ensure that agencies make the best use of emerging technologies in serving the public, I hereby direct each agency to take the following actions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) implement the requirements of the Strategy within 12 months of the date of this memorandum and comply with the timeframes for specific actions specified therein; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, create a page on its website, located at www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy, to publicly report progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable format.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and with appropriate protections for privacy and civil liberties.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">Barack Obama.      </p>
